@article{Ribba:2012uq,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop a tumor growth inhibition model for adult diffuse low-grade gliomas (LGG) able to describe tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using longitudinal mean tumor diameter (MTD) data from 21 patients treated with first-line procarbazine, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-l-nitrosourea, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy, we formulated a model consisting of a system of differential equations, incorporating tumor-specific and treatment-related parameters that reflect the response of proliferative and quiescent tumor tissue to treatment. The model was then applied to the analysis of longitudinal tumor size data in 24 patients treated with first-line temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and in 25 patients treated with first-line radiotherapy.
RESULTS: The model successfully described the MTD dynamics of LGG before, during, and after PCV chemotherapy. Using the same model structure, we were also able to successfully describe the MTD dynamics in LGG patients treated with TMZ chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Tumor-specific parameters were found to be consistent across the three treatment modalities. The model is robust to sensitivity analysis, and preliminary results suggest that it can predict treatment response on the basis of pretreatment tumor size data.
CONCLUSIONS: Using MTD data, we propose a tumor growth inhibition model able to describe LGG tumor size evolution in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. In the future, this model might be used to predict treatment efficacy in LGG patients and could constitute a rational tool to conceive more effective chemotherapy schedules.},

@article{Chan:2005fk,
	Abstract = {The purpose of the study was to describe the population pharmacokinetics of levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease studied in 5 trials (10 occasions) over 4 years. Twenty previously untreated Parkinsonian patients were investigated. Each trial consisted of a 2-hr IV infusion of levodopa (1 mg/kg/h) with concomitant oral carbidopa given on two occasions separated by 72 hr with no levodopa in between. This trial design was repeated at 6, 12, 24 and 48 months. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model with central volume (V1), peripheral volume (V2), clearance (CL) and inter-compartmental clearance (CL(ic)) was used to fit plasma levodopa concentrations. The model accounted for levodopa dosing prior to each trial and endogenous levodopa synthesis. Population parameter estimates (geometric mean) and population parameter variability (PPV; SD of normal distribution) were V1 11.4 l/70 kg (0.44), CL 30.9 l/h/70 kg (0.25), V2 27.3 l/70 kg (0.27), and CL(ic) 34.6 l/h/70 kg (0.48). PPV was partitioned into between subject variability (BSV) which was 0.12 V1, 0.13 CL, 0.15 V(2), 0.28 CL(ic), within trial variability (WTV) which was 0.16 V1, 0.13 CL, 0.08 V2, 0.18 CL(ic) and between trial variability (BTV) which was 0.40 V1, 0.17 CL, 0.21 V2, 0.34 CL(ic.) Neither structural nor random levodopa pharmacokinetic parameters were associated with the time course of development of fluctuation in motor response. Variability in levodopa pharmacokinetic parameters (particularly V1) may result in variability in plasma levodopa concentrations that could contribute to fluctuations in motor response.},

The software has been instrumental in raising awareness of Bayesian modelling among both academic and commercial communities internationally, and has enjoyed considerable success over its 20-year life span. Despite this, the software has a number of shortcomings and a principal aim of this paper is to provide a balanced critical appraisal, in particular highlighting how various ideas have led to unprecedented flexibility while at the same time producing negative side effects.

	Abstract = {Phase I clinical trials are an essential step in the development of anticancer drugs. The main goal of these studies is to establish the recommended dose and/or schedule of new drugs or drug combinations for phase II trials. The guiding principle for dose escalation in phase I trials is to avoid exposing too many patients to subtherapeutic doses while preserving safety and maintaining rapid accrual. Here we review dose escalation methods for phase I trials, including the rule-based and model-based dose escalation methods that have been developed to evaluate new anticancer agents. Toxicity has traditionally been the primary endpoint for phase I trials involving cytotoxic agents. However, with the emergence of molecularly targeted anticancer agents, potential alternative endpoints to delineate optimal biological activity, such as plasma drug concentration and target inhibition in tumor or surrogate tissues, have been proposed along with new trial designs. We also describe specific methods for drug combinations as well as methods that use a time-to-event endpoint or both toxicity and efficacy as endpoints. Finally, we present the advantages and drawbacks of the various dose escalation methods and discuss specific applications of the methods in developmental oncotherapeutics.},

	Abstract = {Mixed-effect Markov chain models have been recently proposed to characterize the time course of transition probabilities between sleep stages in insomniac patients. The most recent one, based on multinomial logistic functions, was used as a base to develop a final model combining the strengths of the existing ones. This final model was validated on placebo data applying also new diagnostic methods and then used for the inclusion of potential age, gender, and BMI effects. Internal validation was performed through simplified posterior predictive check (sPPC), visual predictive check (VPC) for categorical data, and new visual methods based on stochastic simulation and estimation and called visual estimation check (VEC). External validation mainly relied on the evaluation of the objective function value and sPPC. Covariate effects were identified through stepwise covariate modeling within NONMEM VI. New model features were introduced in the model, providing significant sPPC improvements. Outcomes from VPC, VEC, and external validation were generally very good. Age, gender, and BMI were found to be statistically significant covariates, but their inclusion did not improve substantially the model's predictive performance. In summary, an improved model for sleep internal architecture has been developed and suitably validated in insomniac patients treated with placebo. Thereafter, covariate effects have been included into the final model.},

	Abstract = {Mixture modeling within the context of pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) mixed effects modeling is a useful tool to explore a population for the presence of two or more subpopulations, not explained by evaluated covariates. At present, statistical tests for the existence of mixed populations have not been developed. Therefore, a simulation study was undertaken to evaluate mixture modeling with NONMEM and explore the following questions. First, what is the probability of concluding that a mixed population exists when there truly is not a mixture (false positive significance level)? Second, what is the probability of concluding that a mixed population (two subpopulations) exists when there is truly a mixed population (power), and how well can the mixture be estimated, both in terms of the population parameters and the individual subjects classification. Seizure count data were simulated using a Poisson distribution such that each subject's count could decrease from its baseline value, as a function of dose via an Emax model. The dosing design for the simulation was based on a trial with the investigational anti-epileptic drug pregabalin. Four hundred and forty seven subjects received pregabalin as add on therapy for partial seizures, each with a baseline seizure count and up to three subsequent seizure counts. For the mixtures, the two subpopulations were simulated to differ in their Emax values and relative proportions. One subpopulation always had its Emax set to unity (Emax hi), allowing the count to approach zero with increasing dose. The other subpopulation was allowed to vary in its Emax value (Emax lo = 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0) and in its relative proportion (pr) of the population (pr = 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, and 0.50) giving a total of 4.4 = 16 different mixtures explored. Three hundred data sets were simulated for each scenario and estimations performed using NONMEM. Metrics used information about the parameter estimates, their standard errors (SE), the difference between minimum objective function (MOF) values for mixture and non-mixture models (MOF (delta)), the proportion of subjects classified correctly, and the estimated conditional probabilities of a subject being simulated as having Emax lo (Emax hi) given that they were estimated as having Emax lo (Emax hi) and being estimated as having Emax lo (Emax hi) given that they were simulated as having Emax lo (Emax hi). The false positive significance level was approximately 0.04 (using all 300 runs) or 0.078 (using only those runs with a successful covariance step), when there was no mixture. When simulating mixed data and for those characterizations with successful estimation and covariance steps, the median (range) percentage of 95% confidence intervals containing the true values for the parameters defining the mixture were 94% (89-96%), 89.5% (58-96%), and 95% (92-97%) for pr, Emax lo, and Emax hi, respectively. The median value of the estimated parameters pr, Emax lo (excluding the case when Emax lo was simulated to equal 0) and Emax hi within a scenario were within +/- 28% of the true values. The median proportion of subjects classified correctly ranged from 0.59 to 0.96. In conclusion, when no mixture was present the false positive probability was less than 0.078 and when mixtures were present they were characterized with varying degrees of success, depending on the nature of the mixture. When the difference between subpopulations was greater (as Emax lo approached zero or pr approached 0.5) the mixtures became easier to characterize.},

	Abstract = {There has been little evaluation of maximum likelihood approximation methods for non-linear mixed effects modelling of count data. The aim of this study was to explore the estimation accuracy of population parameters from six count models, using two different methods and programs. Simulations of 100 data sets were performed in NONMEM for each probability distribution with parameter values derived from a real case study on 551 epileptic patients. Models investigated were: Poisson (PS), Poisson with Markov elements (PMAK), Poisson with a mixture distribution for individual observations (PMIX), Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP), Generalized Poisson (GP) and Negative Binomial (NB). Estimations of simulated datasets were completed with Laplacian approximation (LAPLACE) in NONMEM and LAPLACE/Gaussian Quadrature (GQ) in SAS. With LAPLACE, the average absolute value of the bias (AVB) in all models was 1.02% for fixed effects, and ranged 0.32-8.24% for the estimation of the random effect of the mean count (lambda). The random effect of the overdispersion parameter present in ZIP, GP and NB was underestimated (-25.87, -15.73 and -21.93% of relative bias, respectively). Analysis with GQ 9 points resulted in an improvement in these parameters (3.80% average AVB). Methods implemented in SAS had a lower fraction of successful minimizations, and GQ 9 points was considerably slower than 1 point. Simulations showed that parameter estimates, even when biased, resulted in data that were only marginally different from data simulated from the true model. Thus all methods investigated appear to provide useful results for the investigated count data models.},

Chebyshev-Hermite polynomials are used to show that the correlation coefficient is smaller in the PN scale than the original scale. We use the Frechet bounds to obtain expressions for the lower and upper bounds of the correlation coefficient. A numerical routine is used to compute the bounds.

	Abstract = {The simultaneous assessment of quantitative indexes of insulin secretion and action in a single individual is important when quantifying their relative role in the evolution of glucose tolerance in different physiopathological states. Available methods quantify these indexes in relatively nonphysiological conditions, e.g., during glucose clamps or intravenous glucose tolerance tests. Here, we present a method based on a physiological test applicable to large-scale genetic and epidemiologic studies-the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Plasma C-peptide, insulin, and glucose data from a frequently sampled OGTT with 22 samples throughout 300 min (FSOGTT300-22) were analyzed in 11 subjects with various degrees of glucose tolerance. In each individual, two indexes of pancreatic sensitivity to glucose (phis [10(9) min(-1)] and phid [10(9)]) and the insulin sensitivity index (SI) (10(5) dl/kg per min per pmol/l) were estimated by using the minimal model of C-peptide secretion and kinetics originally proposed for intravenous graded glucose infusion and the minimal model approach recently proposed for meal/OGTTs. The indexes obtained from FSOGTT300-22 were used as a reference for internal validation of OGTT protocols with reduced sampling schedules. Our results show that 11 samples in a 300-min period (OGTT300-11) is the test of choice because the indexes it provides (phis = 36 +/- 3 [means +/- SE]; phid = 710 +/- 111; SI = 10.2 +/- 2.4) show excellent correlation and are not statistically different from those of FSOGTT300-22 (phis = 33 +/- 3; phid = 715 +/- 120; SI = 10.1 +/- 2.3). In conclusion, OGTT300-11, interpreted with C-peptide and glucose minimal models, provides a quantitative description of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in a single individual while preserving the important clinical classification of glucose tolerance provided by the standard 120-min OGTT.},

	Abstract = {Given the increase in the incidence of insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, it would be of paramount importance to assess quantitative indices of insulin secretion and action during a physiological perturbation, such as a meal or an oral glucose-tolerance test (OGTT). A minimal model method is proposed to measure quantitative indices of insulin secretion and action in adolescents from an oral test. A 7 h, 21-sample OGTT was performed in 11 adolescents. The C-peptide minimal model was identified on C-peptide and glucose data to quantify indices of beta-cell function: static phi(s) and dynamic phi(d) responsivity to glucose from which total responsivity phi was also measured. The glucose minimal model was identified on glucose and insulin data to estimate insulin sensitivity, S(I), which was compared to a reference measure, S(I)(ref), provided by a tracer method. Disposition indices, which adjust insulin secretion for insulin action, were then calculated. Indices of beta-cell function were phi(s) = 51.35 +/- 8.89 x 10(-9)min(-1), phi(d) = 1,392 +/- 258 x 10(-9), and phi = 82.09 +/- 17.70 x 10(-9)min(-1). Insulin sensitivity was S(I) = 14.19 +/- 2.73 x 10(-4), not significantly different from S(I)(ref) = 14.96 +/- 3.04 x 10(-4) dl/kg.min per microU/ml, and well correlated: r = 0.98, P < 0.0001, thus indicating that S(I) can be accurately measured from an oral test. Disposition indices were DI(s) = 1,040 +/- 201 x 10(-14) dl/kg/min(2) per pmol/l, DI(d) = 33,178 +/- 10,720 x 10(-14) dl/kg/min per pmol/l, DI = 1,844 +/- 522 x 10(-14) dl/kg/min(2) per pmol/l. Virtually the same minimal model assessment was obtained with a reduced 3 h, 9-sample protocol. OGTT interpreted with C-peptide and glucose minimal model has the potential to provide novel insight regarding the regulation of glucose metabolism in adolescents, and to evaluate the effect of obesity and interventions such as diet and exercise.},

@article{Ganguly:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Numerous studies have implicated mutations in tubulin or the overexpression of specific tubulin genes in resistance to microtubule-targeted drugs. Much less is known about the role of accessory proteins that modulate microtubule behavior in the genesis of drug resistance. Here, we examine mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK), a member of the kinesin family of microtubule motor proteins that has the ability to stimulate microtubule depolymerization, and show that overexpressing the protein confers resistance to paclitaxel and epothilone A, but increases sensitivity to colcemid. Cells transfected with FLAG-tagged MCAK cDNA using a tet-off-regulated expression system had a disrupted microtubule cytoskeleton and were able to survive a toxic concentration of paclitaxel in the absence, but not in the presence of tetracycline, showing that drug resistance was caused by ectopic MCAK production. Moreover, a population that was heterogeneous with respect to FLAG-MCAK expression became enriched with cells that produced the ectopic protein when it was placed under paclitaxel selection. Similar to previously isolated mutants with altered tubulin, paclitaxel resistant cells resulting from MCAK overexpression were found to have decreased microtubule polymer and a seven-fold increase in the frequency of microtubule detachment from centrosomes. These data are consistent with a model for paclitaxel resistance that is based on stability of the attachment of microtubules to their nucleating centers, and they implicate MCAK in the mechanism of microtubule detachment.},

	Abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques have revolutionized the field of Bayesian statistics by enabling posterior inference for arbitrarily complex models. The now widely used WinBUGS software has, over the years, made the methodology accessible to a great many applied scientists, in all fields of research. Despite this, serious application of MCMC methods within the field of population PK/PD has been comparatively limited. We appreciate that for many applied pharmacokineticists the prospect of conducting a Bayesian analysis will require numerous alien concepts to be taken on board and it may be difficult to justify investing the time and effort required in order to understand them (especially since the approach is so computer-intensive). For this reason we provide here a thorough (but often informal) discussion of all aspects of Bayesian inference as they apply specifically to population PK/PD. We also acknowledge that while the WinBUGS software is general purpose, model specification for some types of problem, population PK/PD being a prime example, can be very difficult, to the extent that a specialized interface for describing the problem at hand is often a practical necessity. In the latter part of this paper we describe such an interface, namely PKBugs. A principal aim of the paper is to offer sufficient technical background, in an easy to follow format, that the reader may develop both the confidence and know-how to make appropriate use of the PKBugs/WinBUGS framework (or similar software) for their own data analysis needs, should they choose to adopt a Bayesian approach.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the metabolic and genetic basis of diabetes in the Cohen Diabetic rat, a model of diet-induced diabetes, as a means to identify the molecular mechanisms involved. By altering individual components in the diabetogenic diet, we established that the dietary susceptibility that leads to the development of diabetes in this model is directly related to the high casein and low copper content in chow. The development of diabetes is accompanied by depletion of the acini from the exocrine pancreas and replacement with fat cells, while the appearance of the islets of Langerhans remains intact. With reversion back from diabetogenic to regular diet, the diabetic phenotype disappears but the histological changes in the exocrine pancreas prevail. Using positional cloning, we detected a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on rat chromosome 4 with a chromosomal span of 4.9 cM, and two additional loci on chromosomes 7 and X. A screen for genes within that QTL in the rat and in the syntenic regions in mouse and man revealed only 23 candidate genes. Notable among these genes is Ica1, which has been causally associated with diabetes and bovine casein. We conclude that the development of diabetes in our model is dependent upon high casein and low copper in diet, that it is accompanied by histomorphological changes in the exocrine but not endocrine pancreas, that it is reversible, and that it is associated with a major QTL on chromosome 4 in which we detected Ica1, a high priority candidate gene.},

@article{Efanov:2005aa,
	Abstract = {The glucose-sensing enzyme glucokinase (GK) plays a key role in glucose metabolism. We report here the effects of a novel glucokinase activator, LY2121260. The activator enhanced GK activity via binding to the allosteric site located in the hinge region of the enzyme. LY2121260 stimulated insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner in pancreatic beta-cells and increased glucose use in rat hepatocytes. In addition, incubation of beta-cells with the GK activator resulted in increased GK protein levels, suggesting that enhanced insulin secretion on chronic treatment with a GK activator may be due to not only changed enzyme kinetics but also elevated enzyme levels. Animals treated with LY2121260 showed an improved glucose tolerance after oral glucose challenge. These results support the concept that GK activators represent a new class of compounds that increase both insulin secretion and hepatic glucose use and in doing so may prove to be effective agents for the control of blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.},

	Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the optimal conditions under which to assess glucose tolerance in chow- and high-fat-fed C57BL/6J mice. Mice were fed either chow or high-fat diet for 8 wk. Variables tested were fasting duration (0-, 3-, 6-, and 24-h and overnight fasting), route of administration (intraperitoneal vs. oral) load of glucose given (2, 1, or 0.5 g/kg and fixed 50-mg dose), and state of consciousness. Basal glucose concentrations were increased in high-fat- compared with chow-fed mice following 6 h of fasting (9.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.4 mmol/l P = 0.01). Glucose tolerance was most different and therefore significant (P = 0.001) in high-fat-fed mice after 6 h of fasting (1,973 +/- 96 vs. 1,248 +/- 83 mmol.l(-1).120 min(-1)). The difference in glucose tolerance was greater following an OGTT (142\%), in contrast to an IPGTT, with a 127\% difference between high fat and chow. We also found that administering 2 g/kg of glucose resulted in a greater level of significance (P = 0.0008) in glucose intolerance in high-fat- compared with chow-fed mice. A fixed dose of 50 mg glucose regardless of body weight was enough to show glucose intolerance in high-fat- vs. chow-fed mice. Finally, high-fat-fed mice showed glucose intolerance compared with their chow-fed counterparts whether they were tested under conscious or anesthetized conditions. We conclude that 2 g/kg glucose administered orally following 6 h of fasting is best to assess glucose tolerance in mice under these conditions.},

@article{Sumiyoshi:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Intakes of some macronutrients can comprise risk factors for life-style-related diseases such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. In this study, we examined the effects in C57BL/6J mice of consuming excess fat or sucrose for a long period of time (55 wk). Another group of mice consumed a low-fat, low-sucrose (LL) diet. Mice fed the high-fat (HF) diet gained weight and developed hyperlipidemia and hyperleptinemia. At 25 wk, but not at 55 wk, hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity of the mice fed the high sucrose (HS) diet was greater than that of mice fed the LL or HF diet. Those fed the HS diet were not obese and had greater hepatic lipogenic and gluconeogenic enzyme activities. The HF and HS diets resulted in different types of glucose intolerance. In an oral glucose tolerance test, mice fed the HF diet had a delay in the clearance of glucose compared with those fed the LL diet, perhaps due to the peripheral insulin resistance that resulted from higher levels of circulating free fatty acids. Feeding the HS diet for 55 wk induced hyperglycemia 10 min after oral glucose administration, although blood glucose declined rapidly after i.p. insulin injection. This finding suggests that the effects of chronic HS diet intake may be due to the reduction in early insulin secretion from pancreatic islets and the increase in sucrase activity in the small intestine. It is important to consider the effects of macronutrients in lean as well as obese mice to clarify the pathogenesis of the metabolic disorders.},

	Abstract = {Hyperglycemia of diabetes is caused in part by perturbation of hepatic glucose metabolism. Hepatic glucokinase (GK) is an important regulator of glucose storage and disposal in the liver. GK levels are lowered in patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young and in some diabetic animal models. Here, we explored the adenoviral vector-mediated overexpression of GK in a diet-induced murine model of type 2 diabetes as a treatment for diabetes. Diabetic mice were treated by intravenous administration with an E1/E2a/E3-deleted adenoviral vector encoding human hepatic GK (Av3hGK). Two weeks posttreatment, the Av3hGK-treated diabetic mice displayed normalized fasting blood glucose levels (95 +/- 4.8 mg/dl; P < 0.001) when compared with Av3Null (135 +/- 5.9 mg/dl), an analogous vector lacking a transgene, and vehicle-treated diabetic mice (134 +/- 8 mg/dl). GK treatment also resulted in lowered insulin levels (632 +/- 399 pg/ml; P < 0.01) compared with the control groups (Av3Null, 1,803 +/- 291 pg/ml; vehicle, 1,861 +/- 392 pg/ml), and the glucose tolerance of the Av3hGK-treated diabetic mice was normalized. No significant increase in plasma or hepatic triglycerides, or plasma free fatty acids was observed in the Av3hGK-treated mice. These data suggest that overexpression of GK may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.},

	Abstract = {One challenge for veterinarians, animal facilities and research scientists is the making of physiological estimates appropriate to a variety of species for which data are often either completely lacking or are incomplete. Our intent in compiling the data in this paper is to provide the best possible database of normal physiological and anatomical values primarily (though not exclusively) for four common mammalian model species: mouse, rat, dog and man. In order to make those data as accessible and applicable as possible, we have presented the results of this study in the form of body-size dependent allometric equations in which some variable (Y) is expressed as a dependent function of body mass (M) in the power-law equation, Y = aM(b). By compiling these data, it is apparent that the resultant equations are quantitatively grouped (with similar slope or 'b' values). These emergent patterns provide insights into body-size dependent 'principles of design' that seem to dictate several aspects of design and function across species among all mammals. In general, the weights of most individual organs scale as a constant fraction of body mass (i.e. the body mass exponent, b approximately equal to 1.0). Biological rates (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate) scale as b approximately equal to -1/4. Finally, volume-rates (the product of volume and rate) such as cardiac output, ventilation and oxygen uptake vary as b approximately equal to 3/4.},

	Abstract = {A mathematical model of normal glucose/insulin homoeostasis has been based on the known, experimentally determined responses of the liver and periphery to different glucose/insulin concentrations. Different defects of glucose resistance and insulin resistance have been applied to the model to investigate the degree to which these abnormalities could successfully predict the range of fasting glucose and insulin values found in normal, obese, and diabetic subjects. Modeling glucose resistance or insulin resistance at the liver or the periphery alone did not increase the plasma glucose to levels observed in diabetes, even when associated with marked deficiency of beta-cell function. A defect of either glucose resistance or insulin resistance affecting both periphery and liver allowed a wider range of basal glucose and insulin concentration values, but resulted in unphysiologically low hepatic glucose output: with modeling insulin resistance, hyperglycemia suppressed glucose output, whereas with glucose resistance, raised insulin levels suppressed hepatic glucose output. A wide range of glucose and insulin values, with appropriate basal hepatic glucose output, could only be modeled by insulin resistance at both the liver and periphery with additional glucose resistance at the liver. The modeling results are in accord with investigative studies that suggest secondary hepatic and peripheral glucose resistance in response to hyperglycemia. Modeling provides a systematic means of examining the likely effect of different putative defects in a complex physiological system.},

Dedicated to the memory of Reinhart Heinrich, this paper discusses the origin and evolution of the new part of systems biology that relates to metabolic and signal-transduction pathways and extends mathematical biology so as to address postgenomic experimental reality. Various approaches to modeling the dynamics generated by metabolic and signal-transduction pathways are compared. The silicon cell approach aims to describe the intracellular network of interest precisely, by numerically integrating the precise rate equations that characterize the ways macromolecules' interact with each other. The non-equilibrium thermodynamic or 'lin-log' approach approximates the enzyme rate equations in terms of linear functions of the logarithms of the concentrations. Biochemical Systems Analysis approximates in terms of power laws. Importantly all these approaches link system behavior to molecular interaction properties. The latter two do this less precisely but enable analytical solutions. By limiting the questions asked, to optimal flux patterns, or to control of fluxes and concentrations around the (patho)physiological state, Flux Balance Analysis and Metabolic/Hierarchical Control Analysis again enable analytical solutions. Both the silicon cell approach and Metabolic/Hierarchical Control Analysis are able to highlight where and how system function derives from molecular interactions. The latter approach has also discovered a set of fundamental principles underlying the control of biological systems. The new law that relates concentration control to control by time is illustrated for an important signal transduction pathway, i.e. nuclear hormone receptor signaling such as relevant to bone formation. It is envisaged that there is much more Mathematical Biology to be discovered in the area between molecules and Life.},

@article{Geenen:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Ophthalmic acid (OA), an endogenous tripeptide analogue of glutathione, has been suggested as a potential biomarker for paracetamol/acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. Here HPLC-MS/MS methods have been developed for the precise, sensitive and specific detection and quantification of OA in in vitro cell culture medium and plasma. For the cell culture medium the LLOQ was found to be 1 ng/ml, with less than 1\% between sample carry over at all concentrations and precision below 15\% for within day and below 9\% for between day analyses. For rat plasma the presence of endogenous OA resulted in the LLOQ being 25 ng/ml (defined as the lowest concentration on the calibration curve where the base peak was less than 20\% of the LLOQ). For the plasma assay the percentage carry over was less than 1\% for all concentrations and within and between batch precision was below 21\%. The methods were linear for both sample types from the LLOQ up to 5 μg/ml. The method was successfully applied to the determination of OA in samples obtained following the chronic administration of the rat hepatotoxin methapyrilene, where plasma OA concentrations were observed to show a weak negative correlation with those of established liver injury biomarkers such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST).},

@article{Hornberg:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Cancer research has focused on the identification of molecular differences between cancerous and healthy cells. The emerging picture is overwhelmingly complex. Molecules out of many parallel signal transduction pathways are involved. Their activities appear to be controlled by multiple factors. The action of regulatory circuits, cross-talk between pathways and the non-linear reaction kinetics of biochemical processes complicate the understanding and prediction of the outcome of intracellular signaling. In addition, interactions between tumor and other cell types give rise to a complex supra-cellular communication network. If cancer is such a complex system, how can one ever predict the effect of a mutation in a particular gene on a functionality of the entire system? And, how should one go about identifying drug targets? Here, we argue that one aspect is to recognize, where the essence resides, i.e. recognize cancer as a Systems Biology disease. Then, more cancer biologists could become systems biologists aiming to provide answers to some of the above systemic questions. To this aim, they should integrate the available knowledge stemming from quantitative experimental results through mathematical models. Models that have contributed to the understanding of complex biological systems are discussed. We show that the architecture of a signaling network is important for determining the site at which an oncologist should intervene. Finally, we discuss the possibility of applying network-based drug design to cancer treatment and how rationalized therapies, such as the application of kinase inhibitors, may benefit from Systems Biology.},

	Abstract = {Systems Biology aims to understand quantitatively how properties of biological systems can be understood as functions of the characteristics of, and interactions between their macromolecular components. Whereas, traditional biochemistry focused on isolation and characterization of cellular components, the challenge for Systems Biology lies in integration of this knowledge and the knowledge about molecular interactions. Computer models play an important role in this integration. We here discuss an approach with which we aim to link kinetic models on small parts of metabolism together, so as to form detailed kinetic models of larger chunks of metabolism, and ultimately of the entire living cell. Specifically, we will discuss techniques that can be used to model a sub-network in isolation of a larger network of which it is a part, while still maintaining the dynamics of the larger complete network. We will start by outlining the JWS online system, the silicon cell project, and the type of models we propose. JWS online is a model repository, which can be used for the storage, simulation and analysis of kinetic models. We advocate to integrate a top-down approach, where measurements on the complete system are used to derive fluxes in a detailed structural model, with a bottom-up approach, consisting of the integration of molecular mechanism-based detailed kinetic models into the structural model.},

@article{Venter:2001aa,
	Abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90\% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25\% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1\% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24\% is in introns, with 75\% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1\% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

	Abstract = {With the growing importance of computational models in systems biology there has been much interest in recent years to develop standard model interchange languages that permit biologists to easily exchange models between different software tools. In the present chapter two chief model exchange standards, SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) and CellML are described. In addition, other related features including visual layout initiatives, ontologies and best practices for model annotation are discussed. Software tools such as developer libraries and basic editing tools are also introduced, together with a discussion on the future of modelling languages and visualization tools in systems biology.},

@article{Belfiore:1998aa,
	Abstract = {Insulin Sensitivity Indices for glycemia [ISI(gly)] and blood FFA [ISI(ffa)] can be calculated with the formulas: ISI(gly) = 2/[(INSp x GLYp) + 1], and ISI(ffa) = 2/[(INSp x FFAp) + 1], where INSp, GLYp and FFAp = insulinemic, glycemic, and FFA areas during OGTT (75 g glucose) of the person under study, simplified by considering only data at 0 and 2 h (0-2 h areas), according to WHO criteria or, better, at 0, 1 and 2 h (0-1-2 h areas). Expressed as unit/ volume.h-1, 0-1-2 h area is equal to 1/2 value at 0 min + value at 1 h + 1/2 value at 2 h, while 0-2 h area is equal to value at 0 + value at 2 h. Instead of areas, basal levels can also be used. Basal levels and areas are expressed taking the mean normal value as unit, so that in normal subjects ISI(gly) and ISI(ffa) are always around 1, with maximal variations between 0 and 2. Each laboratory should have its normal reference values for basal levels and OGTT areas. However, reliable mean normal values were selected from literature. Based on meta-analysis of published data, ISI(gly) and ISI(ffa) were reduced in subjects who were overweight and/or IGT and in NIDDM patients and their relatives. Moreover, correlation of ISI(gly) with the euglycemic clamp data was significant. However, it should be stressed that the clamp procedure is performed under artificially induced steady-state whereas ISI(gly) and ISI(ffa) are obtained under rather physiological conditions, with hormonal and metabolic variables unmodified, thus being suitable to assess whole-body insulin sensitivity in the clinical setting.},

@article{Gutt:2000aa,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore possible calculations using oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) values in order to develop a simple measure of insulin sensitivity. We devised a formula for an insulin sensitivity index, ISI(0,120), that uses the fasting (0 min) and 120 min post-oral glucose (OGTT) insulin and glucose concentrations. It appears to be generalizable across a spectrum of glucose tolerance and obesity. Most importantly, our data show that ISI(0,120) correlates well, when applied prospectively in comparative studies, with the insulin sensitivity index obtained from the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (r = 0.63, P < 0.001). This correlation was demonstrably superior to other indices of insulin sensitivity such as the HOMA formula presented by Matthews, and performed comparably to the computerized HOMA index. Measurement of insulin sensitivity has traditionally been possible only in research settings because of the invasiveness and expense of the methods used. Clinical investigators have therefore sought more practical methods to obtain an index of insulin sensitivity. Such an index should approximate insulin sensitivity as measured by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (M). We present ISI(0,120), a simple yet sensitive measure of insulin sensitivity which is adaptable for use in clinical settings as well as large epidemiologic studies.},

@article{PROCESSCURATION,
	Abstract = {In bioinformatics, we are familiar with the idea of curated data as a prerequisite for data integration. We neglect, often to our cost, the curation and cataloguing of the processes that we use to integrate and analyse our data. Programmatic access to services, for data and processes, means that compositions of services can be made that represent the in silico experiments or processes that bioinformaticians perform. Data integration through workflows depends on being able to know what services exist and where to find those services. The large number of services and the operations they perform, their arbitrary naming and lack of documentation, however, mean that they can be difficult to use. The workflows themselves are composite processes that could be pooled and reused but only if they too can be found and understood. Thus appropriate curation, including semantic mark-up, would enable processes to be found, maintained and consequently used more easily. This broader view on semantic annotation is vital for full data integration that is necessary for the modern scientific analyses in biology. This article will brief the community on the current state of the art and the current challenges for process curation, both within and without the Life Sciences.},

	Abstract = {Motivation: Research in systems biology is carried out through a combination of experiments and models. Several data standards have been adopted for representing models (Systems Biology Markup Language) and various types of relevant experimental data (such as FuGE and those of the Proteomics Standards Initiative). However, until now, there has been no standard way to associate a model and its entities to the corresponding datasets, or vice versa. Such a standard would provide a means to represent computational simulation results as well as to frame experimental data in the context of a particular model. Target applications include model-driven data analysis, parameter estimation, and sharing and archiving model simulations.Results: We propose the Systems Biology Results Markup Language (SBRML), an XML-based language that associates a model with several datasets. Each dataset is represented as a series of values associated with model variables, and their corresponding parameter values. SBRML provides a flexible way of indexing the results to model parameter values, which supports both spreadsheet-like data and multidimensional data cubes. We present and discuss several examples of SBRML usage in applications such as enzyme kinetics, microarray gene expression and various types of simulation results.Availability and Implementation: The XML Schema file for SBRML is available at http://www.comp-sys-bio.org/SBRML under the Academic Free License (AFL) v3.0.Contact: pedro.mendes@manchester.ac.ukSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	Abstract = {Insulin resistance contributes to the pathophysiology of diabetes and is a hallmark of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and many cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, quantifying insulin sensitivity/resistance in humans and animal models is of great importance for epidemiological studies, clinical and basic science investigations, and eventual use in clinical practice. Direct and indirect methods of varying complexity are currently employed for these purposes. Some methods rely on steady-state analysis of glucose and insulin, whereas others rely on dynamic testing. Each of these methods has distinct advantages and limitations. Thus, optimal choice and employment of a specific method depends on the nature of the studies being performed. Established direct methods for measuring insulin sensitivity in vivo are relatively complex. The hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp and the insulin suppression test directly assess insulin-mediated glucose utilization under steady-state conditions that are both labor and time intensive. A slightly less complex indirect method relies on minimal model analysis of a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. Finally, simple surrogate indexes for insulin sensitivity/resistance are available (e.g., QUICKI, HOMA, 1/insulin, Matusda index) that are derived from blood insulin and glucose concentrations under fasting conditions (steady state) or after an oral glucose load (dynamic). In particular, the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) has been validated extensively against the reference standard glucose clamp method. QUICKI is a simple, robust, accurate, reproducible method that appropriately predicts changes in insulin sensitivity after therapeutic interventions as well as the onset of diabetes. In this Frontiers article, we highlight merits, limitations, and appropriate use of current in vivo measures of insulin sensitivity/resistance.},

@article{Gizatullin:2006aa,
	Abstract = {VX-680 is a potent inhibitor of Aurora kinases that induces the accumulation of cells with > or =4N DNA content, followed by cell death. Here, we define the role of p53 and p21(Waf1/Cip1) in cell cycle perturbations following exposure to VX-680. Endoreduplication and apoptosis in response to VX-680 are limited in A549 and MCF-7 cells expressing wild-type p53, and markedly enhanced in cells lacking p53, including those engineered to express the HPV16-E6 oncoprotein or short interfering RNA pools targeting p53. In contrast, endoreduplication and apoptosis occur in the p53 wild-type cell lines, RKO and U2OS. The difference in response to VX-680 among these cell lines correlates with the timing of induction of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and its ability to inhibit cyclin E-cdk2 activity. In A549 cells, VX-680 induces the expression of p53 and p21(Waf1/Cip1) within 24 hours, with consequent inhibition of cyclin E-cdk2, and reduction of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, limiting endoreduplication. In RKO and U2OS cells, the induction of p21(Waf1/Cip1) is delayed and associated with higher residual cyclin E-cdk2 kinase activity and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation, followed by progressive endoreduplication and apoptosis. Abrogation of p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression by short interfering RNA targeting in A549 cells results in a substantial increase in the degree of endoreduplication, whereas inducible expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1) in p53-negative NCI-H1299 cells inhibits VX-680-induced endoreduplication and cell death. These data suggest that the integrity of the p53-p21(Waf1/Cip1)-dependent postmitotic checkpoint governs the response to Aurora kinase inhibition. Although cells with intact checkpoint function arrest with 4N DNA content, those with compromised checkpoint function are more likely to undergo endoreduplication followed by eventual apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {This report presents detailed information on age- and gender-related differences in the anatomical and physiological characteristics of reference individuals. These reference values provide needed input to prospective dosimetry calculations for radiation protection purposes for both workers and members of the general public. The purpose of this report is to consolidate and unify in one publication, important new information on reference anatomical and physiological values that has become available since Publication 23 was published by the ICRP in 1975. There are two aspects of this work. The first is to revise and extend the information in Publication 23 as appropriate. The second is to provide additional information on individual variation among grossly normal individuals resulting from differences in age, gender, race, or other factors. This publication collects, unifies, and expands the updated ICRP reference values for the purpose of providing a comprehensive and consistent set of age- and gender-specific reference values for anatomical and physiological features of the human body pertinent to radiation dosimetry. The reference values given in this report are based on: (a) anatomical and physiological information not published before by the ICRP; (b) recent ICRP publications containing reference value information; and (c) information in Publication 23 that is still considered valid and appropriate for radiation protection purposes. Moving from the past emphasis on 'Reference Man', the new report presents a series of reference values for both male and female subjects of six different ages: newborn, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and adult. In selecting reference values, the Commission has used data on Western Europeans and North Americans because these populations have been well studied with respect to antomy, body composition, and physiology. When appropriate, comparisons are made between the chosen reference values and data from several Asian populations. The first section of the report provides summary tables of all the anatomical and physiological parameters given as reference values in this publication. These results give a comprehensive view of reference values for an individual as influenced by age and gender. The second section describes characteristics of dosimetric importance for the embryo and fetus. Information is provided on the development of the total body and the timing of appearance and development of the various organ systems. Reference values are provided on the mass of the total body and selected organs and tissues, as well as a number of physiological parameters. The third section deals with reference values of important anatomical and physiological characteristics of reference individuals from birth to adulthood. This section begins with details on the growth and composition of the total body in males and females. It then describes and quantifies anatomical and physiological characteristics of various organ systems and changes in these characteristics during growth, maturity, and pregnancy. Reference values are specified for characteristics of dosimetric importance. The final section gives a brief summary of the elemental composition of individuals. Focusing on the elements of dosimetric importance, information is presented on the body content of 13 elements: calcium, carbon, chloride, hydrogen, iodine, iron, magnesium, nitrogen, oxygen, potassium, sodium, sulphur, and phosphorus.},

	Abstract = {CCR7 is implicated in lymph node metastasis of cancer, but its role is obscure. We report a mechanism explaining how interstitial flow caused by lymphatic drainage directs tumor cell migration by autocrine CCR7 signaling. Under static conditions, lymphatic endothelium induced CCR7-dependent chemotaxis of tumor cells through 3D matrices. However, interstitial flow induced strong increases in tumor cell migration that were also CCR7 dependent, but lymphatic independent. This autologous chemotaxis correlated with metastatic potential in four cell lines and was verified by visualizing directional polarization of cells in the flow direction. Computational modeling revealed that transcellular gradients of CCR7 ligand were created under flow to drive this response. This illustrates how tumor cells may be guided to lymphatics during metastasis.},

	Abstract = {The pattern of growth of human breast cancer is important theoretically and clinically. Speer et al. (Cancer Res., 44: 4124-4130, 1984) have recently proposed that all individual tumors initially grow with identical Gompertzian parameters, but subsequently develop kinetic heterogeneity by a random time-dependent process. This concept has elicited interest because it fits clinical data for the survival of untreated patients, for the progression of shadows on serial paired mammograms, and for time-to-relapse following mastectomy. The success of these curve-fits is compelling, and the model has been applied to clinical trials. However, the assumption of uniform nascent growth is not supported by theory or data, and individual cancers have not been shown to follow the complex growth curves predicted by the Speer model. As an alternative, if kinetic heterogeneity is understood to be an intrinsic property of neoplasia, the same three historical data sets are fit well by an unadorned Gompertzian model which is parsimonious and has many other intuitive and empirical advantages. The two models differ significantly in such clinical projections as the estimated duration of silent growth prior to diagnosis and the anticipated optimal chemotherapy schedule postsurgery.},

Multicellular spheroids serve as experimental model system for the study of avascular tumor growth. Typically, multicellular spheroids consist of a necrotic core surrounded by rings of quiescent and proliferating tumor cells, respectively. Furthermore, after an initial exponential growth phase further spheroid growth is significantly slowed down even if further nutrient is supplied. The cellular automaton model explicitly takes into account mitosis, apoptosis and necrosis as well as nutrient consumption and a diffusible signal that is emitted by cells becoming necrotic. All cells follow identical interaction rules. The necrotic signal induces a chemotactic migration of tumor cells towards maximal signal concentrations. Starting from a small number of tumor cells automaton simulations exhibit the self-organized formation of a layered structure consisting of a necrotic core, a ring of quiescent tumor cells and a thin outer ring of proliferating tumor cells.},

The E2F transcription factors function in cell cycle control and are intimately regulated by RB. Studies of model organisms have revealed conserved functions for E2Fs during development, suggesting that the cancer-related proliferative roles of E2F family members represent a recent evolutionary adaptation. However, given that some human tumours have concurrent RB1 inactivation and E2F amplification and overexpression, we propose that there are alternative tumour-promoting activities for the E2F family, which are independent of cell cycle regulation.},

@article{Moreno-Sanchez:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Much of the search for the "magic cancer bullet" or "block buster" has followed the expectation of a single gene or protein as "the rate-limiting step" for tumor persistence. Examples continue to abound: EGFR, VEGFR, Akt/PI3K, HIF-1α, PHD, PDK, or FAS continue to be targeted individually. However, many such attempts to block a metabolic or signal transduction pathway by targeting, specifically, a single rate-limiting molecule have proven to be unsuccessful. Metabolic control analysis (MCA) of cancer cells has generated a generic explanation for this phenomenon: several steps share the control of energy metabolism (for glycolysis: glucose transporter, hexokinase, glycogen synthesis and ATP demand; for oxidative phosphorylation: respiratory complex I and ATP demand), i.e., there is no single "rate-limiting step". Targeting a type of step that does not exist is unlikely to be a successful paradigm for continued research into drug targeting of cancer. MCA establishes how to determine, quantitatively, the degrees of control that the various enzymes in the intracellular network exert on vital flux (or function) and on the concentration of important metabolites, substituting for the intuitive, qualitative and most often erroneous concept of single rate-limiting step. Moreover, MCA helps to understand (i) the underlying mechanisms by which a given enzyme exerts high or low control, (ii) why the control of the pathway is shared by several pathway enzymes and transporters and (iii) what are the better sets of drug targets. Indeed, by applying MCA it should now be possible to identify the group of proteins (and genes) that should be modified to achieve a successful modulation of the intracellular networks of biotechnological or clinical relevance. The challenge is to move away from the design of drugs that specifically inhibit a single controlling step, towards unspecific drugs or towards drug mixtures, which may have multiple target sites in the most exacerbated, unique and controlling pathways in cancer cells. Successful nonspecific drugs should still be specific for the networks of cancer cells over those of normal cells and to establish such cell-type specificity within molecular non-specificity will continue to require sophisticated analyses. Clinical practice has anticipated the latter strategy of mixtures of drugs: combinations of anti-neoplastic drugs are already administered with encouraging results. Therefore, the most promising strategy for cancer treatment seems to be that of a multi-targeted, MCA-advised, therapy.},

@article{Marin-Hernandez:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Most cancer cells exhibit an accelerated glycolysis rate compared to normal cells. This metabolic change is associated with the over-expression of all the pathway enzymes and transporters (as induced by HIF-1α and other oncogenes), and with the expression of hexokinase (HK) and phosphofructokinase type 1 (PFK-1) isoenzymes with different regulatory properties. Hence, a control distribution of tumor glycolysis, modified from that observed in normal cells, can be expected. To define the control distribution and to understand the underlying control mechanisms, kinetic models of glycolysis of rodent AS-30D hepatoma and human cervix HeLa cells were constructed with experimental data obtained here for each pathway step (enzyme kinetics; steady-state pathway metabolite concentrations and fluxes). The models predicted with high accuracy the fluxes and metabolite concentrations found in living cancer cells under physiological O(2) and glucose concentrations as well as under hypoxic and hypoglycemic conditions prevailing during tumor progression. The results indicated that HK≥HPI>GLUT in AS-30D whereas glycogen degradation≥GLUT>HK in HeLa were the main flux- and ATP concentration-control steps. Modeling also revealed that, in order to diminish the glycolytic flux or the ATP concentration by 50\%, it was required to decrease GLUT or HK or HPI by 76\% (AS-30D), and GLUT or glycogen degradation by 87-99\% (HeLa), or decreasing simultaneously the mentioned steps by 47\%. Thus, these proteins are proposed to be the foremost therapeutic targets because their simultaneous inhibition will have greater antagonistic effects on tumor energy metabolism than inhibition of all other glycolytic, non-controlling, enzymes.

	Abstract = {Angiogenesis, the formation of blood vessels from a pre-existing vasculature, is a process whereby capillary sprouts are formed in response to externally supplied chemical stimuli. The sprouts then grow and develop, driven initially by endothelial-cell migration, and organize themselves into a dendritic structure. Subsequent cell proliferation near the sprout tip permits further extension of the capillary and ultimately completes the process. Angiogenesis occurs during embryogenesis, wound healing, arthritis and during the growth of solid tumors. In this paper we present both continuous and discrete mathematical models which describe the formation of the capillary sprout network in response to chemical stimuli (tumor angiogenic factors, TAF) supplied by a solid tumor. The models also take into account essential endothelial cell-extracellular matrix interactions via the inclusion of the matrix macromolecule fibronectin. The continuous model consists of a system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the initial migratory response of endothelial cells to the TAF and the fibronectin. Numerical simulations of the system, using parameter values based on experimental data, are presented and compared qualitatively with in vivo experiments. We then use a discretized form of the partial differential equations to develop a biased random-walk model which enables us to track individual endothelial cells at the sprout tips and incorporate anastomosis, mitosis and branching explicitly into the model. The theoretical capillary networks generated by computer simulations of the discrete model are compared with the morphology of capillary networks observed in in vivo experiments.},

	Abstract = {To what extent the growth dynamics of tumors is controlled by nutrients, biomechanical forces and other factors at different stages and in different environments is still largely unknown. Here we present a biophysical model to study the spatio-temporal growth dynamics of two-dimensional tumor monolayers and three-dimensional tumor spheroids as a complementary tool to in vitro experiments. Within our model each cell is represented as an individual object and parametrized by cell-biophysical and cell-kinetic parameters that can all be experimentally determined. Hence our modeling strategy allows us to study which mechanisms on the microscopic level of individual cells may affect the macroscopic properties of a growing tumor. We find the qualitative growth kinetics and patterns at early growth stages to be remarkably robust. Quantitative comparisons between computer simulations using our model and published experimental observations on monolayer cultures suggest a biomechanically-mediated form of growth inhibition during the experimentally observed transition from exponential to sub-exponential growth at sufficiently large tumor sizes. Our simulations show that the same transition during the growth of avascular tumor spheroids can be explained largely by the same mechanism. Glucose (or oxygen) depletion seems to determine mainly the size of the necrotic core but not the size of the tumor. We explore the consequences of the suggested biomechanical form of contact inhibition, in order to permit an experimental test of our model. Based on our findings we propose a phenomenological growth law in early expansion phases in which specific biological small-scale processes are subsumed in a small number of effective parameters.},

Its use has significantly contributed to a decline in breast cancer mortality, since breast cancer patients treated with TAM for 5 years exhibit a 30-50\% reduction in both the rate of disease recurrence after 10 years of patient follow-up and occurrence of contralateral breast cancer. However, in patients treated with TAM there is substantial interindividual variability in the development of resistance to TAM therapy, and in the incidence of TAM-induced adverse events, including deep vein thrombosis, hot flashes, and the development of endometrial cancer. This article will focus on the UDP glucuronosyltransferases, a family of metabolizing enzymes that are responsible for the deactivation and clearance of TAM and TAM metabolites, and how interindividual differences in these enzymes may play a role in patient response to TAM.},

	Abstract = {Although activity of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes (CYPs) plays a major role in the fate of anticancer agents in patients, there are relatively few clinical studies that evaluate drug metabolism with therapeutic outcome. Nevertheless, many clinical reports in various non-oncology fields have shown the dramatic importance of CYP activity in therapeutic efficacy, safety and interindividual variability of drug pharmacokinetics. Moreover, variability of drug metabolism in the liver as well as in cancer cells must also be considered as a potential factor mediating cancer resistance. This review underlines the role of drug metabolism mediated by CYPs in pharmacokinetic variability, drug resistance and safety. As examples, biotransformation pathways of tamoxifen, paclitaxel and imatinib are reviewed. This review emphasises the key role of therapeutic drug monitoring as a complementary tool of investigation to in vitro data. For instance, pharmacokinetic data of anticancer agents have not often been published within subpopulations of patients who show ultra-rapid, extensive or poor metabolism (e.g. due to CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 genotypes). Besides kinetic variability in the systemic circulation, induction of CYP activity may participate in creating drug resistance by speeding up the cancer agent degradation specifically in the target cells. For one cancer agent, various mechanisms of resistance are usually identified within different cell clones. This review also tries to emphasise that drug resistance mediated by CYP activity in cancer cells should be taken into consideration to a greater degree. The unequivocal identification of the metabolising enzymes involved in clinical conditions will eventually allow improvement and individualisation of anticancer agent therapy, i.e. drug dosage and selection. In addition, a more complete understanding of the metabolism of anticancer agents will assist in the prediction of drug-drug interactions, as anticancer agent combinations are becoming more prevalent.},

	Abstract = {Cytochrome P450 enzymes are essential for the metabolism of many medications. Although this class has more than 50 enzymes, six of them metabolize 90 percent of drugs, with the two most significant enzymes being CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Genetic variability (polymorphism) in these enzymes may influence a patient's response to commonly prescribed drug classes, including beta blockers and antidepressants. Cytochrome P450 enzymes can be inhibited or induced by drugs, resulting in clinically significant drug-drug interactions that can cause unanticipated adverse reactions or therapeutic failures. Interactions with warfarin, antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and statins often involve the cytochrome P450 enzymes. Knowledge of the most important drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, as well as the most potent inhibiting and inducing drugs, can help minimize the possibility of adverse drug reactions and interactions. Although genotype tests can determine if a patient has a specific enzyme polymorphism, it has not been determined if routine use of these tests will improve outcomes.},

	Abstract = {Topotecan (TPT) is a topoisomerase I inhibitor, and like the other drugs of this family, it is believed to act in a specific way on cells in S phase at the time of treatment. Exploiting a new method, coupling a particular experimental plan with computer simulation, a complete quantitative study of the time dependence and dose dependence of the activity of cell cycle controls has become feasible, and the overall scenario of events after treatment can be reconstructed in detail. We were able to demonstrate that the response of an ovarian cancer cell line to 1 h of treatment with TPT is not limited to inhibition of DNA synthesis, leading to cell death, but involves G(1) and G(2)-M checkpoints. G(1) and G(2)-M block, recycling, and death follow specific dose-dependent kinetics, lasting no less than 3 days after treatment. We also found that cells treated outside S phase contribute significantly to the overall activity. The utility of this analysis was demonstrated by reproducing more complex treatment schemes in which low TPT concentrations were applied for 1 h three times at 24-h intervals. In this case, the simulation clarified the origin of the auto-potentiation observed with repeated 0.2 micro M treatments, in which the cytotoxicity, particularly against S-phase cells, was higher than the cytotoxicity in cells treated with 10 micro M only once. We believe that this approach will help us to understand the complexity and heterogeneity of the response of a cell population to a drug challenge and could help us to establish the rationale for drug scheduling or drug combinations.},

	Abstract = {Computational models of cancer chemotherapy have the potential to streamline clinical trial design, contribute to the design of rational, tailored treatments, and facilitate our understanding of experimental results. Mechanistic models based on functional data from tumor biopsies will enable physicians to predict response to treatment for a specific patient, in contrast to statistical models in which the probability of response for a given patient may differ substantially from the population average. While microarray analyses of gene expression also show promise for guiding individualized treatments, it may be difficult to link statistical mining of microarray data with mechanistic, tailored treatments. Furthermore, gene expression does not identify how drugs should be scheduled. This review summarizes mechanistic mathematical models developed to improve the design of chemotherapy regimens. Mechanistic models that incorporate both genetic resistance and cell cycle-mediated resistance during treatment with multiple drugs will be most useful in designing treatment regimens tailored for individuals. Because there are already a number of papers that address the applications of microarray technology, we will limit our discussion to the contrasts between mechanistic computational models and microarray technology, and how these two approaches may complement one another.},

	Abstract = {The available mathematical models describing tumor growth and the effect of anticancer treatments on tumors in animals are of limited use within the drug industry. A simple and effective model would allow applying quantitative thinking to the preclinical development of oncology drugs. In this article, a minimal pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model is presented, based on a system of ordinary differential equations that link the dosing regimen of a compound to the tumor growth in animal models. The growth of tumors in nontreated animals is described by an exponential growth followed by a linear growth. In treated animals, the tumor growth rate is decreased by a factor proportional to both drug concentration and number of proliferating tumor cells. A transit compartmental system is used to model the process of cell death, which occurs at later times. The parameters of the pharmacodynamic model are related to the growth characteristics of the tumor, to the drug potency, and to the kinetics of the tumor cell death. Therefore, such parameters can be used for ranking compounds based on their potency and for evaluating potential differences in the tumor cell death process. The model was extensively tested on discovery candidates and known anticancer drugs. It fitted well the experimental data, providing reliable parameter estimates. On the basis of the parameters estimated in a first experiment, the model successfully predicted the response of tumors exposed to drugs given at different dose levels and/or schedules. It is, thus, possible to use the model prospectively, optimizing the design of new experiments.},

Here, we present a new simulation model in normal humans that describes the physiological events that occur after a meal, by employing the quantitative knowledge that has become available in recent years. Model parameters were set to fit the mean data of a large normal subject database that underwent a triple tracer meal protocol which provided quasi-model-independent estimates of major glucose and insulin fluxes, e.g., meal rate of appearance, endogenous glucose production, utilization of glucose, insulin secretion. By decomposing the system into subsystems, we have developed parametric models of each subsystem by using a forcing function strategy. Model results are shown in describing both a single meal and normal daily life (breakfast, lunch, dinner) in normal. The same strategy is also applied on a smaller database for extending the model to type 2 diabetes.},

	Abstract = {Computer assisted learning has an important role in the teaching of pharmacokinetics to health sciences students because it transfers the emphasis from the purely mathematical domain to an 'experiential' domain in which graphical and symbolic representations of actions and their consequences form the major focus for learning. Basic pharmacokinetic concepts can be taught by experimenting with the interplay between dose and dosage interval with drug absorption (e.g. absorption rate, bioavailability), drug distribution (e.g. volume of distribution, protein binding) and drug elimination (e.g. clearance) on drug concentrations using library ('canned') pharmacokinetic models.

Such 'what if' approaches are found in calculator-simulators such as PharmaCalc, Practical Pharmacokinetics and PK Solutions. Others such as SAAM II, ModelMaker, and Stella represent the 'systems dynamics' genre, which requires the user to conceptualise a problem and formulate the model on-screen using symbols, icons, and directional arrows.

The choice of software should be determined by the aims of the subject/course, the experience and background of the students in pharmacokinetics, and institutional factors including price and networking capabilities of the package(s). Enhanced learning may result if the computer teaching of pharmacokinetics is supported by tutorials, especially where the techniques are applied to solving problems in which the link with healthcare practices is clearly established.},

	Abstract = {ISEC (Insulin SECretion) is a computer program which calculates pre-hepatic insulin secretion from plasma C-peptide measurements. The program uses a regression (population) model to derive parameters of C-peptide kinetics from;subject's gender, type (normal, obese, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), age, weight, and height. Insulin secretion is calculated as a piece-wise constant (step) function with flexible step length allowing for a fine resolution of the secretion profile between measurements. A constrained regularisation method of deconvolution is employed to carry out the calculations. The calculated profile satisfies three properties: (i) it fits the measurement within the given level of the measurement error, (ii) it is non-negative, and (iii) it has a minimum value of a regularisation criterion (norm of second differences) which quantifies the degree of deviation of the secretion profile from a straight line. Both theoretical aspects and specific features related to ISEC are considered. To exemplify the use of ISEC, pre-hepatic insulin secretion is calculated during meal tolerance test, frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamp, and basal conditions with frequent sampling.},

	Abstract = {Availability of quantitative indexes of insulin secretion is important for definition of the alterations in beta -cell responsivity to glucose associated with different physiopathological states. This is presently possible by using the intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) in conjunction with the C-peptide minimal model. However, the secretory response to a more physiological slowly increasing/decreasing glucose stimulus may uncover novel features of beta -cell function. Therefore, plasma C-peptide and glucose data from a graded glucose infusion protocol (seven 40-min periods of 0, 4, 8, 16, 8, 4, and 0 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)) in eight normal subjects were analyzed by use of a new model of insulin secretion and kinetics. The model assumes a two-compartment description of C-peptide kinetics and describes the stimulatory effect on insulin secretion of both glucose concentration and the rate at which glucose increases. It provides in each individual the insulin secretion profile and three indexes of pancreatic sensitivity to glucose: Phi (s), Phi (d), and Phi (b), related, respectively, to the control of insulin secretion by the glucose level (static control), the rate at which glucose increases (dynamic control), and basal glucose. Indexes (means +/- SE) were Phi (s) = 18.8 +/- 1.8 (10(9) min(-1)), Phi (d) = 222 +/- 30 (10(9)), and Phi (b) = 5.2 +/- 0.4 (10(9) min(-1)). The model also allows one to quantify the beta -cell times of response to increasing and decreasing glucose stimulus, equal to 5.7 +/- 2.2 (min) and 17.8 +/- 2.0 (min), respectively. In conclusion, the graded glucose infusion protocol, interpreted with a minimal model of C-peptide secretion and kinetics, provides a quantitative assessment of pancreatic function in an individual. Its application to various physiopathological states should provide novel insights into the role of insulin secretion in the development of glucose intolerance.},

@article{Dalla-Man:2002bs,
	Abstract = {Recently, a new approach has been proposed to estimate insulin sensitivity (S-I) from an oral glucose tolerance test or a meal using an "integral equation". Here, we improve on the "integral equation" by resorting to a "differential equation" approach. The classic glucose kinetics minimal model was used with the addition of a parametric model for the rate of appearance into plasma of oral glucose (Ra). Three behavioral models of Ra were proposed: piecewise-linear (P), spline (S) and dynamic (D). All three models performed satisfactorily allowing a precise estimation of S, and a plausible reconstruction of Ra. Mean S, estimates were virtually identical: S-I(P) = 6.81 +/- 0.87 (SE); S-I(S) = 6.53 +/- 0.80; and S-I(D) = 6.62 +/- 0.79. S-I strongly correlated with the integral-equation index (1) S-I(I): r = 0.99, p < 0.01 for models D and S, and r = 0.97, p < 0.01 for P. Also, S-I compared well with insulin sensitivity estimated from intravenous glucose tolerance test in the same subjects (r = 0.75, p < 0.01; r = 0.71, p < 0.01; r = 0.73, p < 0.01, respectively, for P, S, and D models versus S-I(IVGTT)) I Finally, the novel approach allows estimation of S, from a shorter test (120 min): model P yielded S-I(R) = 7.16 +/- 1.0 (R for reduced) which correlated very well with S and (respectively, r = 0.94, p < 0.01; r = 0.95, p < 0.01) and still satisfactorily with SI-VGTT I (r = 0.77, p < 0.01).},

@article{Kim:2007tg,
	Abstract = {A mathematical model of the whole-body metabolism is developed to predict fuel homeostasis during exercise by using hormonal control over cellular metabolic processes. The whole body model is composed of seven tissue compartments: brain, heart, liver, GI (gastrointestinal) tract, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and "other tissues". Each tissue compartment is described by dynamic mass balances and major cellular metabolic reactions. The glucagon-insulin controller is incorporated into the whole body model to predict hormonal changes during exercise. Moderate [150 W power output at 60\% of peak oxygen consumption (VO(2max))] exercise for 60 min was implemented by increasing ATP utilization rates in heart and skeletal muscle. Arterial epinephrine level was given as an input function, which directly affects heart and skeletal muscle metabolism and indirectly other tissues via glucagon-insulin controller. Model simulations were validated with experimental data from human exercise studies. The exercise induced changes in hormonal signals modulated metabolic flux rates of different tissues in a coordinated way to achieve glucose homeostasis, demonstrating the efficacy of hormonal control over cellular metabolic processes. From experimental measurements of whole body glucose balance and arterial substrate concentrations, this model could predict the dynamic changes of hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, which are not easy to measure experimentally, suggesting the higher contribution of glycogenolysis ( approximately 75\%). In addition, it could provide dynamic information on the relative contribution of carbohydrates and lipids for fuel oxidation in skeletal muscle. Model simulations indicate that external fuel supplies from other tissue/organ systems to skeletal muscle become important for prolonged exercise emphasizing the significance of interaction among tissues. In conclusion, this model can be used as a valuable complement to experimental studies due to its ability to predict what is difficult to measure directly, and usefulness to provide information about dynamic behaviors.},

	Abstract = {Today, in silico studies and trial simulations already complement experimental approaches in pharmaceutical R\&D and have become indispensable tools for decision making and communication with regulatory agencies. While biology is multiscale by nature, project work, and software tools usually focus on isolated aspects of drug action, such as pharmacokinetics at the organism scale or pharmacodynamic interaction on the molecular level. We present a modeling and simulation software platform consisting of PK-Sim({\textregistered}) and MoBi({\textregistered}) capable of building and simulating models that integrate across biological scales. A prototypical multiscale model for the progression of a pancreatic tumor and its response to pharmacotherapy is constructed and virtual patients are treated with a prodrug activated by hepatic metabolization. Tumor growth is driven by signal transduction leading to cell cycle transition and proliferation. Free tumor concentrations of the active metabolite inhibit Raf kinase in the signaling cascade and thereby cell cycle progression. In a virtual clinical study, the individual therapeutic outcome of the chemotherapeutic intervention is simulated for a large population with heterogeneous genomic background. Thereby, the platform allows efficient model building and integration of biological knowledge and prior data from all biological scales. Experimental in vitro model systems can be linked with observations in animal experiments and clinical trials. The interplay between patients, diseases, and drugs and topics with high clinical relevance such as the role of pharmacogenomics, drug-drug, or drug-metabolite interactions can be addressed using this mechanistic, insight driven multiscale modeling approach.},

It includes receptor activation and mitogenic signaling, initiation of cell cycle, and passage of checkpoints and apoptosis. Time-course experiments measuring mRNA abundance and protein activity are conducted on Caco-2 and HCT 116 colon cell lines. These data were used to constrain unknown regulatory interactions and kinetic parameters via sensitivity analysis and parameter optimization methods contained in the DigitalCell(TM) computer simulation platform. FACS, RNA knockdown, cell growth, and apoptosis data are also used to constrain the model and to identify unknown pathways, and cross talk between known pathways will also be discussed. Using the cell simulation, GNS tested the efficacy of various drug targets and performed validation experiments to test computer simulation predictions. The simulation is a powerful tool that can in principle incorporate patient-specific data on the DNA, RNA, and protein levels for assessing efficacy of therapeutics in specific patient populations and can greatly impact success of a given therapeutic strategy.},

	Abstract = {Eventually to understand the integrated function of the cell cycle regulatory network, we must organize the known interactions in the form of a diagram, map, and/or database. A diagram convention was designed capable of unambiguous representation of networks containing multiprotein complexes, protein modifications, and enzymes that are substrates of other enzymes. To facilitate linkage to a database, each molecular species is symbolically represented only once in each diagram. Molecular species can be located on the map by means of indexed grid coordinates. Each interaction is referenced to an annotation list where pertinent information and references can be found. Parts of the network are grouped into functional subsystems. The map shows how multiprotein complexes could assemble and function at gene promoter sites and at sites of DNA damage. It also portrays the richness of connections between the p53-Mdm2 subsystem and other parts of the network.},

	Abstract = {Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling is being used increasingly as a tool in drug development because often in phase III clinical trials only sparse data are available for analysis and so a nonlinear mixed effects modelling approach has to be adopted. Specialist data analytical techniques and software are required to analyse such data. This article reviews some of the software currently available for performing nonlinear mixed effects modelling.

A questionnaire was devised and sent to a number of software producers and the findings are presented and discussed in this paper. The programs could be grouped into 3 main categories: parametric and nonparametric maximum likelihood and Bayesian.

It was apparent from the questionnaire that software development for population data analysis is a very active area of investigation. The implementation of methodologies varied widely between the packages: some were self-contained programs, whereas others were written within another application, usually a statistical package. They also varied with respect to their ease of use and level of support offered by the software producers. Although robustness and reliability are important concerns, they were not addressed in the present review. Most of the programs surveyed are in continual development.},

	Abstract = {A major challenge for drug development and environmental or occupational health is the prediction of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between drugs, natural chemicals or environmental contaminants. This article reviews briefly past developments in the area of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling of interactions. It also demonstrates a systems biology approach to the question, and the capabilities of new software tools to facilitate that development. Individual Systems Biology Markup Language models of metabolic pathways can now be automatically merged and coupled to a template PBPK pharmacokinetic model, using for example the GNU MCSim software. The global model generated is very efficient and able to simulate the interactions between a theoretically unlimited number of substances. Development time and the number of model parameter increase only linearly with the number of substances considered, even though the number of possible interactions increases exponentially.},

	Abstract = {The model proposed here links together two approaches to describe tumours: a continuous medium to describe the movement and the mechanical properties of the tissue, and a population dynamics approach to represent internal genetic inhomogeneity and instability of the tumour. In this way one can build models which cover several stages of tumour progression. In this paper we focus on describing transition from aerobic to purely glycolytic metabolism (the Warburg effect) in tumour cords. From the mathematical point of view this model leads to a free boundary problem where domains in contact are characterized by different sets of equations. Accurate stitching of the solution was possible with a modified ghost fluid method. Growth and death of the cells and uptake of the nutrients are related through ATP production and energy costs of the cellular processes. In the framework of the bi-population model this allowed to keep the number of model parameters relatively small.},

	Abstract = {Although studies have shown that intensive diabetes treatment with the goal of maintaining blood glucose concentrations close to the normal range lead to a substantial reduction of the rate of the complications (e.g. blindness, kidney failure, amputations and circulatory diseases), this can be difficult to achieve using conventional means. It is recognised that a number of patients may have poor control despite specialist care, and this along with devolution of care to non-specialists suggests that alternative interventions should be developed. DiasNet, which is used by patients as a tool for education and communication, is based on a well documented decision support system used by clinicians to give advise on insulin dose. In DiasNet the patients can experiment with their own data, adjusting insulin doses or meals sizes, and thereby learning how to cope with various situations. The system can run both as an ordinary application on a standard PC, and as an Internet application using a standard web browser. The latter enables a new way of communication between patient and clinician. DiasNet is currently being tested on a small group of diabetes patients.},

@article{Vander-Heiden:2009uq,
	Abstract = {In contrast to normal differentiated cells, which rely primarily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate the energy needed for cellular processes, most cancer cells instead rely on aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon termed "the Warburg effect." Aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), however, and the advantage it confers to cancer cells has been unclear. Here we propose that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new cell. Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. A better understanding of the mechanistic links between cellular metabolism and growth control may ultimately lead to better treatments for human cancer.},

	Abstract = {The user experience with the AIDA simulator demonstrates one of the advantages of making such diabetes software readily available for free via the Internet. The comments collectively provide a picture of some of the many and varied ways in which the simulator has been applied by different users. These comments also demonstrate the potential for empowerment that some people feel can result from the use of the software. The experience with this approach is sufficiently encouraging to warrant formal evaluation studies to quantify the clinical utility of such an interactive educational diabetes simulation program. For this reason, a formal survey of 200 AIDA users (patients, relatives, and healthcare professionals) from at least 15 different countries is currently ongoing, and further formal evaluation studies in the clinic setting are planned.},

	Abstract = {AIDA is a diabetes-computing program freely available from www.2aida.org on the Web. The software is intended to serve as an educational support tool, and can be used by anyone who has an interest in diabetes, whether they be patients, relatives, health-care professionals, or students. In previous "Diabetes Information Technology \& WebWatch" columns various indicators of usage of the AIDA program have been reviewed, and various comments from users of the software have been documented. One aspect of AIDA, though, that has been of considerable interest has been to investigate its Web-based distribution as a wider paradigm for more general medically related usage of the Internet. In this respect we have been keen to understand in general terms: (1) why people are turning to the Web for health-care/diabetes information; (2) more specifically, what sort of people are making use of the AIDA software; and (3) what benefits they feel might accrue from using the program. To answer these types of questions we have been conducting a series of audits/surveys via the AIDA Website, and via the software program itself, to learn as much as possible about who the AIDA end users really are. The rationale for this work is that, in this way, it should be possible to improve the program as well as tailor future versions of the software to the interests and needs of its users. However, a recurring observation is that data collection is easiest if it is as unobtrusive and innocuous as possible. One aspect of learning as much as possible about diabetes Website visitors and users may be to apply techniques that do not necessitate any visitor or user interaction. There are various programs that can monitor what pages visitors are viewing at a site. As these programs do not require visitors to do anything special, over time some interesting insights into Website usage may be obtained. For the current study we have reviewed anonymous logstats data, which are automatically collected at many Websites, to try and establish a baseline level of usage for the AIDA site. For the initial pilot study the analysis was performed from October 1, 2000 to November 1, 2001. The study has yielded an interesting insight into how the AIDA Website is being used. The results also confirm those of previous audits based on different self-reported methodologies, confirming, amongst other things, what countries people are visiting from and what operating systems/computers they are using. These analyses have been informative and useful. Given this, it is proposed to repeat the current pilot survey approach on a routine basis, in the future, as a way of monitoring on-going usage of the AIDA Website.},

	Abstract = {Insulin resistance plays an important role in the pathophysiology of diabetes and is associated with obesity and other cardiovascular risk factors. The "gold standard" glucose clamp and minimal model analysis are two established methods for determining insulin sensitivity in vivo, but neither is easily implemented in large studies. Thus, it is of interest to develop a simple, accurate method for assessing insulin sensitivity that is useful for clinical investigations. We performed both hyperinsulinemic isoglycemic glucose clamp and insulin-modified frequently sampled iv glucose tolerance tests on 28 nonobese, 13 obese, and 15 type 2 diabetic subjects. We obtained correlations between indexes of insulin sensitivity from glucose clamp studies (SI(Clamp)) and minimal model analysis (SI(MM)) that were comparable to previous reports (r = 0.57). We performed a sensitivity analysis on our data and discovered that physiological steady state values [i.e. fasting insulin (I(0)) and glucose (G(0))] contain critical information about insulin sensitivity. We defined a quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI = 1/[log(I(0)) + log(G(0))]) that has substantially better correlation with SI(Clamp) (r = 0.78) than the correlation we observed between SI(MM) and SI(Clamp). Moreover, we observed a comparable overall correlation between QUICKI and SI(Clamp) in a totally independent group of 21 obese and 14 nonobese subjects from another institution. We conclude that QUICKI is an index of insulin sensitivity obtained from a fasting blood sample that may be useful for clinical research.},

	Abstract = {An insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGTT) with minimal model analysis was compared with the glucose clamp in 11 subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), 20 with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 24 with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). The insulin sensitivity index (SI) was calculated from FSIGTT using 22- and 12-sample protocols (SI(22) and SI(12), respectively). Insulin sensitivity from the clamp was expressed as SI(clamp) and SIP(clamp). Minimal model parameters were similar when calculated with SI(22) and SI(12). SI could not be distinguished from 0 in approximately 50\% of diabetic patients with either protocol. SI(22) correlated significantly with SI(clamp) in the whole group (r = 0.62), and in the NGT (r = 0.53), IGT (r = 0.48), and NIDDM (r = 0.41) groups (P < 0.05 for each). SI(12) correlated significantly with SI(clamp) in the whole group (r = 0.55, P < 0.001) and in the NGT (r = 0.53, P = 0.046) and IGT (r = 0.58, P = 0.008) but not NIDDM (r = 0.30, P = 0.085) groups. When SI(22), SI(clamp), and SIP(clamp) were expressed in the same units, SI(22) was 66 +/- 5\% (mean +/- SE) and 50 +/- 8\% lower than SI(clamp) and SIP(clamp), respectively. Thus, minimal model analysis of the insulin-modified FSIGTT provides estimates of insulin sensitivity that correlate significantly with those from the glucose clamp. The correlation was weaker, however, in NIDDM. The insulin-modified FSIGTT can be used as a simple test for assessment of insulin sensitivity in population studies involving nondiabetic subjects. Additional studies are needed before using this test routinely in patients with NIDDM.},

	Abstract = {The "minimal model" of glucose disappearance provides noninvasive estimates of insulin sensitivity and glucose effectiveness from an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT). However, this model does not allow the separation of glucose production from utilization. To overcome this limitation, labeled glucose was injected along with cold glucose in six normal dogs, and both cold and labeled glucose time courses were monitored along with insulin concentration. A revised minimal model was fitted to tracer data to obtain new measures of insulin sensitivity (SI* = 6.41 +/- 0.91 10(-4) min-1 X microU-1 X ml-1) and fractional glucose clearance (SG* = 0.0092 +/- 0.0009 min-1). SG* was compared with a direct measure obtained by a hepatic arterial-venous difference technique, which yielded a value of 0.0097 +/- 0.0002, virtually identical to SG*, thereby validating the model estimate. When the original minimal model was identified from cold data, we obtained S1 = 4.52 +/- 1.39 and SG = 0.042 +/- 0.009. SI* and SG* were different from SI and SG, respectively. In particular SG overestimates fractional glucose clearance by approximately five times. The revised minimal model yields glucose disposal parameters SI* and SG* that are not affected by the confounding effect of insulin and glucose inhibition of glucose production. Limitations inherent in cold IVGTT and original minimal model are overcome by labeled IVGTT and the revised minimal model, while test simplicity remains.},

One hundred eight type 2 diabetic patients were divided into tertiles according to fasting levels of plasma glucose (FPG) [T1: 4.2 < or = FPG (mmol/liter) < 6.5, n = 36; T2: 6.5 < or = FPG < 8.1, n = 36; T3: 8.1 < or = FPG < or = 11.1, n = 36]. The association between QUICKI or 1/HOMA-IR and insulin resistance index assessed by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (Clamp-IR) was investigated in each group. QUICKI was strongly correlated with Clamp-IR in all groups (r = 0.615 in T1, r = 0.659 in T2, and r = 0.788 in T3; all subjects, r = 0.691; all P < 0.001). Reciprocal of HOMA-IR also highly correlated with Clamp-IR in all groups (r = 0.600, r = 0.721, and r = 0.730, respectively; all subjects, r = 0.685; all P < 0.001). In conclusion, QUICKI and the reciprocal index of HOMA were highly correlated with Clamp-IR in type 2 diabetic patients with relatively wide ranges of fasting plasma glucose.},

	Abstract = {The prehepatic production of insulin in normal man was evaluated by kinetic analysis of connecting peptide (C-peptide) behavior in the plasma in men and women. Studies were performed during suppression of endogenous insulin secretion (induced by both fasting and exogenous insulin injection) as well as during stimulation of secretion (induced by oral glucose ingestion) and iv glucose injection. Least squares spline fitting of the C-peptide data by interactive computer analysis permitted evaluation of the precursor production of insulin using a two-compartment model for C-peptide removal. Basal prehepatic insulin production averaged 15-4 mU/70 kg.min in 20 subjects and was reduced to 0.9 +/- 2.2 mU/70 kg.min after 84 h of fasting. The injection of exogenous iv insulin resulted in suppression of endogenous production to 0 +/- 2.5 mU/70 kg.min. Maximum prehepatic insulin production induced by a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test was 91 +/- 1.2 mU/70 kg.min, with a cumulative hormone secretion of 11.4 +/- 2.0 U over the 5 h of observation. After the acute iv injection of 25 g glucose, production rose to 465 +/- 108 mU/70 kg.min at 2 min post injection and rapidly returned toward basal. Levels of insulin in the portal vein calculated from this analysis were markedly elevated relative to simultaneous peripheral venous levels. These results quantitate prehepatic insulin production and portal venous insulin concentration from an analysis of the behavior of C-peptide within the plasma in both the steady state and the nonsteady state in man.},

@article{Van-Cauter:1992fk,
	Abstract = {Insulin secretion rates can be accurately estimated from plasma C-peptide levels with a two-compartment model for C-peptide distribution and degradation. In previous studies, the kinetic parameters of C-peptide clearance were derived in each subject from the decay curve observed after bolus intravenous injection of biosynthetic human C-peptide. To determine whether standard parameters for C-peptide clearance could be defined and used to calculate insulin secretion without obtaining a decay curve in each subject, we analyzed 200 decay curves of biosynthetic human C-peptide obtained in normal, obese, and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus subjects studied in our laboratory. This analysis showed that the volume of distribution and kinetic parameters of C-peptide distribution and metabolism vary by less than 30\% in a population highly heterogeneous in terms of age, sex, degree of obesity, and degree of glucose tolerance. The volume of distribution correlated with the degree of obesity as quantified by body surface area (BSA). This dependence of C-peptide distribution volume on BSA was more marked in men than in women. The long half-life was slightly longer in elderly subjects than in younger adults. When effects of BSA, sex, and age were taken into account, the parameters of C-peptide kinetics were very similar in normal, obese, and diabetic subjects. Based on these findings, a simple procedure to derive standard parameters for C-peptide clearance taking into account degree of obesity, sex, and age was defined. These standard parameters resulted in estimations of mean insulin secretion rates, which differed in each subject by only 10-12\% from those obtained with individual parameters. The approach of using standard rather than individual parameters did not systematically underestimate or overestimate insulin secretion so that group values for the fasting secretion rate, the mean 24-h secretion rate, and the number and the amplitude of secretory pulses obtained with standard parameters differed by only 1-2\% from the values obtained with individual parameters. Furthermore, the accuracy of measurements based on standard parameters was not different from that associated with replicate determinations of the parameters of C-peptide clearance in the same subject. We conclude that it is possible to estimate insulin secretion rates from plasma C-peptide levels with standard parameters for C-peptide clearance rather than individually derived parameters without significant loss of accuracy.},

@article{Hovorka:1996fk,
	Abstract = {ISEC (Insulin SECretion) is a computer program which calculates pre-hepatic insulin secretion from plasma C-peptide measurements. The program uses a regression (population) model to derive parameters of C-peptide kinetics from subject's gender, type (normal, obese, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), age, weight, and height. Insulin secretion is calculated as a piece-wise constant (step) function with flexible step length allowing for a fine resolution of the secretion profile between measurements. A constrained regularisation method of deconvolution is employed to carry out the calculations. The calculated profile satisfies three properties: (i) it fits the measurement within the given level of the measurement error, (ii) it is non-negative, and (iii) it has a minimum value of a regularisation criterion (norm of second differences) which quantifies the degree of deviation of the secretion profile from a straight line. Both theoretical aspects and specific features related to ISEC are considered. To exemplify the use of ISEC, pre-hepatic insulin secretion is calculated during meal tolerance test, frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic glucose clamp, and basal conditions with frequent sampling.},

	Abstract = {Highly informative yet simple protocols to assess insulin secretion and action would considerably enhance the quality of epidemiological and large-scale clinical trials. In an effort to develop such protocols, a 5-h, 11-sample oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in 100 individuals and a 7-h, 21-sample meal in another 100. Plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations were measured. We show that virtually the same minimal model assessment of beta-cell responsivity (dynamic [Phi(d)] and static [Phi(s)]), insulin sensitivity (Si), and disposition index (DI) can be obtained with a reduced seven-sample 2-h protocol: Phi(d), reduced versus full: 871.50 vs. 873.32, r = 0.98 in OGTT and 494.88 vs. 477.99 10(-9), r = 0.91 in meal; Phi(s): 42.36 vs. 44.35, r = 0.88 in OGTT and 35.31 vs. 35.37 10(-9) min(-1), r = 0.90 in meal; Si: 24.33 vs. 22.77 10(-5) dl x kg(-1) x min(-1) per pmol/l, r = 0.89 in OGTT and 19.03 vs. 19.77 10(-5) dl x kg(-1) x min(-1) per pmol/l, r = 0.85 in meal; and DI: 1,282.26 vs. 1,273.23, r = 0.84 in OGTT and 726.92 vs. 776.97 10(-14) dl . kg(-1) x min(-2) per pmol/l, r = 0.84 in meal. This reduced protocol will facilitate the study of insulin secretion and action under physiological conditions in nondiabetic humans.},

	Abstract = {A physiologically descriptive model of the biological behavior of cesium in the human body has been constructed around a detailed blood flow model. The rate of transfer from plasma into a tissue is determined by the blood perfusion rate and the tissue-specific extraction fraction of Cs during passage from arterial to venous plasma. Information on tissue-specific extraction of Cs is supplemented with information on the Cs analogues, K and Rb, and known patterns of discrimination between these metals by tissues. The rate of return from a tissue to plasma is estimated from the relative contents of Cs in plasma and the tissue at equilibrium as estimated from environmental studies. Transfers of Cs other than exchange between plasma and tissues (e.g. secretions into the gastrointestinal tract) are based on a combination of physiological considerations and empirical data on Cs or related elements. Model predictions are consistent with the sizable database on the time-dependent distribution and retention of radiocesium in the human body.},

	Abstract = {As part of the revision of the Reference Man model of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), we have reviewed and reanalyzed available data on blood flow and in previous publications have proposed reference values for total and regional blood volumes, total cardiac output, and the distribution of cardiac output. In this paper we unify these proposed features of the revised Reference Man within the framework of a dynamic blood circulation model and show how the model can be used to predict the distribution of decays of short-lived radionuclides after injection or absorption into blood. The total blood volume is partitioned into the blood contents of 24 separate organs or tissues, right heart chambers, left heart chambers, pulmonary circulation, arterial outflow to the systemic tissues (aorta and large arteries), and venous return from the systemic tissues (large veins). As a compromise between physical reality and computational simplicity, the circulation of blood is viewed as a system of first-order transfers between blood pools, but outflow from any given pool is delayed during the first pass of material through the circulation with the delay time depending on the mean transit time across the pool. The model can be used to predict the movement and gradual dispersal of a bolus of material in the circulation after intravascular injection. In contrast to the treatment of the circulation in ICRP Publication 53, Radiation Dose to Patients from Radiopharmaceuticals, the present model allows consideration of incomplete, tissue-dependent extraction of material during passage through the circulation and return of material from tissues to plasma.},

	Abstract = {The rate of appearance (Ra) of glucose in plasma and the contribution of gluconeogenesis were quantified in normal pregnant women early ( approximately 10 wk) and late ( approximately 34 wk) in gestation. Their data were compared with those of normal nonpregnant women. Glucose Ra was measured using the [U-13C]glucose tracer dilution method. Gluconeogenesis was quantified by the appearance of 2H on carbon 5 and 6 of glucose after deuterium labeling of body water pool. Weight-specific glucose Ra was unchanged during pregnancy (nonpregnant, 1.89+/-0.24; first trimester, 2.05+/-0.21; and third trimester 2.17+/-0.28 mg/kg.min, mean+/-SD), while total glucose Ra was significantly increased (early, 133.5+/-7.2; late, 162.6+/-16.4 mg/min; P = 0.005). The fractional contribution of gluconeogenesis via pyruvate measured by 2H enrichment on C-6 of glucose (45-61%), and of total gluconeogenesis quantified from 2H enrichment on C-5 of glucose (i.e. , including glycerol [68-85%]) was not significantly different between pregnant and nonpregnant women. Inasmuch as total glucose Ra was significantly increased, total gluconeogenesis was also increased in pregnancy (early pregnancy, 94.7+/-15.9 mg/min; late pregnancy, 122.7+/-9.3 mg/min; P = 0.003). These data demonstrate the ability of the mother to adapt to the increasing fetal demands for glucose with advancing gestation. The mechanism for this unique quantitative adjustment to the fetal demands remains undefined.},

	Abstract = {In rat adipocytes, insulin dose-response curves were determined for the following effects in the same cells under the same conditions: glucose uptake, binding to insulin receptors (IR), IR autophosphorylation in vivo and in vitro, IR tyrosine kinase activity and insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase. All the EC50 values were essentially the same (mean +/- S.E.M. was 7 +/- 1 nM), except for glucose uptake, which was 170 pM. Using an improved method, we were able to measure PI kinase activity at picomolar concentrations of insulin (> 30 pM) corresponding to the EC50 for glucose uptake. These experiments showed that insulin-stimulated increase in glucose uptake was associated with an increase in antiphosphotyrosine antibody precipitable PI kinase activity, consistent with the view that IR tyrosine kinase activity may be involved in insulin-mediated signaling of glucose uptake. Small peptides (17-25 residues long) derived from major histocompatibility complex class I have previously been shown to inhibit IR internalization without any effect on the affinity of insulin to the receptor. It is now shown that the peptide-mediated inhibition of internalization, which doubles the number of insulin-occupied receptors at an insulin concentration of 70 pM, also results in a corresponding enhancement of PI kinase activity and glucose uptake. Thus, the receptors arrested on the cell surface by the peptide are biologically active.},

Clinicians are increasingly turning to mechanism-based mathematical models for a quantitative definition of physiological defects such as insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and elevated obesity set points, and for predictions of the likely outcomes of therapeutic interventions. However, a very large range of such models is available, making a judicious choice difficult. To better inform this choice, here we present the most important models published to date in a uniform format, discussing similarities and differences in terms of the decisions faced by modellers. We review models for glucostasis, based on the glucose-insulin feedback control loop, and consider extensions to long-term energy balance, dislipidaemia and obesity.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of switch-like response to graded input signal is the theme involved in various signaling pathways in living systems. Positive feedback loops or double negative feedback loops embedded with nonlinearity exhibit these switch-like bistable responses. Such feedback regulations exist in insulin signaling pathway as well. METHODS: In the current manuscript, a steady state analysis of the metabolic insulin-signaling pathway is presented. The threshold concentration of insulin required for glucose transporter GLUT4 translocation was studied with variation in system parameters and component concentrations. The dose response curves of GLUT4 translocation at various concentration of insulin obtained by steady state analysis were quantified in-terms of half saturation constant. RESULTS: We show that, insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation can operate as a bistable switch, which ensures that GLUT4 settles between two discrete, but mutually exclusive stable steady states. The threshold concentration of insulin required for GLUT4 translocation changes with variation in system parameters and component concentrations, thus providing insights into possible pathological conditions. CONCLUSION: A steady state analysis indicates that negative feedback regulation of phosphatase PTP1B by Akt elicits bistability in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. The threshold concentration of insulin required for GLUT4 translocation and the corresponding bistable response at different system parameters and component concentrations was compared with reported experimental observations on specific defects in regulation of the system.},

These tools have recently seen increased utility in the medical arena, and this paper aims to review significant accomplishments made using these approaches. The modeling of metabolic pathways has been applied to better understand disease-state physiology in a variety of cellar, subcellular, and organ systems, including the liver, heart, mitochondria, and cancerous cells. Metabolic pathway engineering has been used to generate cells with novel biochemical functions for therapeutic use, and specific examples are provided in the areas of glycosylation engineering and dopamine-replacement therapy. In order to document the potential of applying both metabolic modeling and pathway manipulation, we describe pertinent advances in the field of diabetes research. Undoubtedly, as the field of metabolic engineering matures and is applied to a wider array of problems, new advances and therapeutic strategies will follow.},

	Abstract = {Glucose transport to the brain involves sophisticated interactions of solutes, transporters, enzymes, and cell signaling processes, within an intricate spatial architecture. The dynamics of the transport are influenced by the adaptive nature of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the semi-impermeable membranes of brain capillaries. As both the gate and the gatekeeper between blood-borne nutrients and brain tissue, the BBB helps govern brain homeostasis. Glucose in the blood must cross the BBB's luminal and abluminal membranes to reach neural tissue. A robust representation of the glucose transport mechanism can highlight a target for brain therapeutic intervention, help characterize mechanisms behind several disease phenotypes, or suggest a new delivery route for drugs. The challenge for researchers is understanding the relationships between influential physiological variables in vivo, and using that knowledge to predict how alterations or interventions affect glucose transport. This paper reviews factors influencing glucose transport and approaches to representing blood-to-brain glucose transport including in vitro, in vivo, and kinetic models. Applications for different models are highlighted, while their limitations in answering arising questions about the human in vivo BBB lead to a discussion of an alternate approach. A developing complex systems simulation is introduced, initiating a single platform to represent the dynamics of glucose transport across the adapting human blood-brain barrier.},

	Abstract = {Glucose is the major substrate that sustains normal brain function. When the brain glucose concentration approaches zero, glucose transport across the blood-brain barrier becomes rate limiting for metabolism during, for example, increased metabolic activity and hypoglycemia. Steady-state brain glucose concentrations in alpha-chloralose anesthetized rats were measured noninvasively as a function of plasma glucose. The relation between brain and plasma glucose was linear at 4.5 to 30 mmol/L plasma glucose, which is consistent with the reversible Michaelis-Menten model. When the model was fitted to the brain glucose measurements, the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant, Kt, was 3.3 +/- 1.0 mmol/L, and the ratio of the maximal transport rate relative to CMRglc, Tmax/CMRglc, was 2.7 +/- 0.1. This Kt is comparable to the authors' previous human data, suggesting that glucose transport kinetics in humans and rats are similar. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was simultaneously assessed and constant above 2 mmol/L plasma glucose at 73 +/- 6 mL 100 g(-1) min(-1). Extrapolation of the reversible Michaelis-Menten model to hypoglycemia correctly predicted the plasma glucose concentration (2.1 +/- 0.6 mmol/L) at which brain glucose concentrations approached zero. At this point, CBF increased sharply by 57% +/- 22%, suggesting that brain glucose concentration is the signal that triggers defense mechanisms aimed at improving glucose delivery to the brain during hypoglycemia.},

	Abstract = {The objective of the study was to determine whether exogenous glucose infusion affects endogenous glucose production in ewes. Mature ewes with catheters placed in the abdominal aorta, two mesenteric veins, the hepatic portal vein and the hepatic vein were used to determine the effect of exogenous glucose infusion on net glucose, insulin, lactate and oxygen flux by the portal-drained viscera (PDV) and liver of conscious sheep. Net hepatic glucose release was determined, and glucose was subsequently infused into either a mesenteric vein or an abdominal vena cava at an equal rate (mmol/L) for 240 min, and net fluxes were determined every 30 min. Arterial concentrations of glucose and insulin increased over time, whereas lactate concentration decreased over time (P < 0.05). Hepatic glucose release decreased linearly over time when glucose was infused into the mesenteric vein (P = 0.03) and tended to decrease linearly when glucose was infused into the abdominal vena cava (P = 0.06). Net PDV and splanchnic plasma insulin release during the vena cava infusion increased linearly over time (P < 0.02). Net PDV blood lactate release did not differ between infusion sites (P = 0.75), nor did the release rate change over time (P > 0.10). Net splanchnic lactate release in the abdominal vena++ cava infusion, however, did decrease over time (P = 0.05). Net hepatic oxygen consumption decreased quadratically over time (P = 0.004) when glucose was infused into the mesenteric vein. In conclusion, infusion of glucose results in a decrease in hepatic glucose production.},

	Abstract = {Decreased insulin sensitivity is associated with diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and hypertension, both independently and in association as what is called the metabolic syndrome. Although the negative effects of obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and high-fat diets on insulin sensitivity are well established, the influence of type and quantity of dietary carbohydrate is more controversial. This study aimed to assess the acute (24 h) effects of a high-sucrose compared with a high-starch diet on insulin sensitivity and to identify changes in blood metabolites that might lead to altered insulin sensitivity. Eight healthy adults consumed high-sucrose or high-starch diets (50% of dietary energy) in a randomized, crossover trial. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by a short insulin tolerance test the following morning. No differences were detected in insulin sensitivity, either for glucose metabolism [Kitt(glucose) (the rate constant for the decline in blood glucose concentrations) for sucrose diet = 3.86%/min, for starch diet = 3.72%/min; pooled SEM = 0.23] or for lipid metabolism [Kitt(NEFA) (the rate constant for the decline in blood fatty acid concentrations) for sucrose diet = 12.9%/min, for starch diet = 11.4%/min; pooled SEM = 1.18]. Profiles for blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations revealed higher peaks and lower troughs with the high-sucrose diet whereas area under the curve for glucose was higher with the high-starch diet (6780 +/- 245 mmol x L/min) than with the high-sucrose diet (6290 +/- 283 mmol x L/min) (P < 0.001). Plasma fatty acid concentrations showed a late postprandial rise with the sucrose-rich diet relative to the starch-rich diet, which was mirrored with a fractionally later peak in triacylglycerol concentrations.},

	Abstract = {The Islets of Langerhans form a nutrient sensing network spread throughout the pancreas. They are tightly connected to the source organ, the intestine, and the target organs--liver, muscle, and fat cells. The expression of a unique set of proteins enables beta cells, the most frequent islet cell type, to detect elevated blood glucose levels and secrete insulin accordingly. Clustered beta-cells achieve tighter regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion by coordination through cell surface proteins. They also adjust their secretory capacity and flow to avoid being damaged. The immediate reaction of the beta cell to nutrients is regulated by translational mechanisms, while longer term adaptations involve changes in transcription. Glucose increases overall protein synthesis in beta-cells but selectively boosts translation of some secretory proteins including insulin. This may be mediated through recognition of RNA motifs in the untranslated regions of those messengers. If essential molecular components of this nutrient sensing system are broken or fail due to repeated stress, beta cells malfunction, which on a larger scale manifest as diseases like diabetes mellitus.},

It identifies areas of uncertainty: distribution and concentrations of glucose in interstitial fluid, kinetics and mechanism of transcapillary glucose transport, kinetics and mechanism of glucose transport via its transporters into cells, detailed mechanisms by which hormones, exercise, and hypoxia affect glucose movement across cell membranes, whether translocation of glucose transporters to the cell membrane accounts completely, or even mainly, for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, whether exercise stimulates release of a circulating insulinomimetic factor, and the relation between muscle glucose uptake and muscle blood flow. The review points out that there is no compartment of glucose in the body at which all glucose is at the same concentration, and that models of glucose metabolism, including effects of insulin on glucose metabolism based on assumptions of concentration homogeneity, cannot be entirely correct. A fresh approach to modeling is needed.},

	Abstract = {Insulin flux was determined in the portal vein and simultaneously arterial blood glucose was measured before and during an oral glucose meal in conscious normal and pancreatic islet cell-autotransplanted dogs to test their insulinogenic reserve. These dogs had previously been chronically instrumented with blood flow probes on the portal vein and carotid artery, and blood sampling catheters in the portal vein, hepatic vein, carotid artery, and right external jugular vein. Such a model permits quantitative portal-peripheral comparisons and assessment of hepatic extraction. Sixteen dogs, 10 normal (N) and six long-term (2 months to 2 yrs) islet cell-transplanted dogs (IT) were fed an oral glucose meal as a test (OMT). Baseline portal vein insulin fluxes (PVF) were similar in both groups (25.6 +/- 0.04 pmol/min in N and 24.7 +/- 19.4 pmol/min in IT). Immediately after OMT, PVF rose to 248.2 +/- 40.9 pmol/min in N, but only to 55.9 +/- 17.9 pmol/min in IT. After 30 min PVF peaked for the second time in N at 156 +/- 35.9 pmol/min, declining slowly to baseline after 3 h. In IT, a similar peak at 30 min was seen (143.7 +/- 22.1 pmol/min), declining to a value not different from baseline after 3 h. However, cumulative insulin PV fluxes in the two groups over 3 h were not different. Differences were also seen in postprandial glucose fluctuations, which reached a maximum excursion of 11.8 +/- 0.45 mM in IT, while never rising above 7.8 +/- 0.33 mM in N. After 3 h both groups had similar glucose values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {A mathematical model of the insulin-glucose feedback regulation in man is used to examine the effects of an oscillatory supply of insulin compared to a constant supply at the same average rate. We show that interactions between the oscillatory insulin supply and the receptor dynamics can be of minute significance only. It is possible, however, to interpret seemingly conflicting results of clinical studies in terms of their different experimental conditions with respect to the hepatic glucose release. If this release is operating near an upper limit, an oscillatory insulin supply will be more efficient in lowering the blood glucose level than a constant supply. If the insulin level is high enough for the hepatic release of glucose to nearly vanish, the opposite effect is observed. For insulin concentrations close to the point of inflection of the insulin-glucose dose-response curve an oscillatory and a constant insulin infusion produce similar effects.},

	Abstract = {Several attempts at building a satisfactory model of the glucose-insulin system are recorded in the literature. The minimal model, which is the model currently mostly used in physiological research on the metabolism of glucose, was proposed in the early eighties for the interpretation of the glucose and insulin plasma concentrations following the intravenous glucose tolerance test. It is composed of two parts: the first consists of two differential equations and describes the glucose plasma concentration time-course treating insulin plasma concentration as a known forcing function; the second consists of a single equation and describes the time course of plasma insulin concentration treating glucose plasma concentration as a known forcing function. The two parts are to be separately estimated on the available data. In order to study glucose-insulin homeostasis as a single dynamical system, a unified model would be desirable. To this end, the simple coupling of the original two parts of the minimal model is not appropriate, since it can be shown that, for commonly observed combinations of parameter values, the coupled model would not admit an equilibrium and the concentration of active insulin in the "distant" compartment would be predicted to increase without bounds. For comparison, a simple delay-differential model is introduced, is demonstrated to be globally asymptotically stable around a unique equilibrium point corresponding to the pre-bolus conditions, and is shown to have positive and bounded solutions for all times. The results of fitting the delay-differential model to experimental data from ten healthy volunteers are also shown. It is concluded that a global unified model is both theoretically desirable and practically usable, and that any such model ought to undergo formal analysis to establish its appropriateness and to exclude conflicts with accepted physiological notions.},

	Abstract = {We propose an approach to quantifying the sensitivity of B cells to glucose in the intact organism, whereby we interpret the complex dynamic plasma insulin response to glucose injection in terms of a minimal mathematical model of posthepatic insulin delivery and insulin clearance. The best model for this purpose was chosen by comparing the ability of a series of proposed models to account precisely for plasma insulin dynamics. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) (300 mg/kg) were performed on conscious dogs, and blood was sampled frequently until the basal steady state was reestablished. Glucose injection produced variable plasma insulin responses, which were characterized by an early peak (76 microU/ml above basal), a plateau with occasional additional peaks, and by an abrupt return of plasma insulin to basal by 37 min. A set of eight models was examined; one emerged as superior, in that it was able to account for insulin dynamics with the smallest number of physiologically meaningful parameters (N = 4). The chosen (minimal) model assumes that (1) clearance of insulin is of the first order, (2) the initial peak represents a bolus of insulin loaded into the plasma after the glucose injection, and (3) the rate of the secondary rise in insulin is determined by the concentration of glucose in plasma above a specific threshold value. The sensitivity of first phase insulin delivery to glucose (phi 1; 1.28 +/- 0.15 microU/ml per min per mg/dl), the sensitivity of the secondary phase to glucose concentration [phi 2; 0.038 +/- 0.005 (microU/mg) . min-2], and the threshold for glucose stimulation of second phase secretion (h; 125 +/- 8 mg/100 ml) were all precisely estimated from the dynamic insulin responses. These three parameters of insulin kinetics (phi 1, phi 2, and h) can be calculated from a single IVGTT, and they characterize the insulin responsiveness of a single individual. Estimating these characteristic parameters of insulin kinetics from IVGTT data has potential for quantitating the individual factors contributing to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in intact animal models, and it may be applicable to man.},

	Abstract = {We have evaluated the feasibility of using a mathematical model of glucose disappearance to estimate insulin sensitivity. Glucose was injected into conscious dogs at 100, 200, or 300 mg/kg. The measured time course of insulin was regarded as the "input," and the falling glucose concentration as the "output" of the physiological system storing and using glucose. Seven mathematical models of glucose uptake were compared to identify the representation most capable of simulating glucose disappearance. One specific nonlinear model was superior in that it 1) predicted the time course of glucose after glucose injection, 2) had four parameters that could be precisely estimated, and 3) described individual experiments with similar parameter values. Insulin sensitivity index (SI), defined as the dependence of fractional glucose disappearance on plasma insulin, was the ratio of two parameters of the chosen model and could be estimated with good reproducibility from the 300 mg/kg injection experiments (SI = 7.00 X 10(-4) +/- 24% (coefficient of variation) min-1/(microU/ml) (n = 8)). Thus, from a single glucose injection it is possible to obtain a quantitative index of insulin sensitivity that may have clinical applicability.},
