\chapter{Features supported by \pharmml}
\label{chap:scope}


\section{Introduction}

The scope of pharmacometric models is very wide, as such models can be empirical as well as
mechanistic; describe continuous as well as discrete data types; and be deterministic, stochastic
or a mixture of both. It is a challenging endeavour to accommodate this variety of possibilities
under one computational standard, therefore it is indispensable to split the task into multiple
steps of subsequent specifications and to define precisely the scope of every release.

In this chapter we define the scope of the functionality in
\pharmml. In particular what information a \pharmml document can
represent and what it cannot. As is common practise in software
engineering we have described the functionality as a set of
``features''. These features are said to be \emph{current} if they are
provided by this release of \pharmml, \emph{planned} if they are not
in the current version, but planned for a future release.
% and \emph{not  include} if we wish to highlight the fact that we believe \pharmml
%will not include this feature. 
It is important to remember that this
specification is just the beginning of \pharmml and over time we
expect many of the features currently out of scope to be provided by
future releases of the language.

The language is organised into three sections, which we believe naturally
describe the logical organisation of a pharmacometric model and its
associated tasks. Consequently we have grouped the features to match this
organisation. The sections are:
\begin{description}
\item[Model Definition] A description of the model, incl.\ the structural model, the model
  parameters, relevant covariates, the variability components, and the observations.
\item[Trial Design] A description of the design of a clinical trial associated with the model
  (for example a trial from which data is available to estimate the parameters of the model or
  a trial to be simulated with the model).
\item[Modelling Steps] A description of steps or tasks performed with
  the model. Typically this describes how the model has been used, for
  example to estimate its parameters or to perform a simulation.
\end{description}

\feat{A structural model defined by a set of algebraic equations.} Typically the explicit solution to a simple PK model, or a dose-response model.
\feat{A structural model defined by a system of ODEs with initial conditions.} Such systems of ODEs can include algebraic equations as well.
\feat{A structural model defined in \sbml format.}
\feat{A structural model from an external resource or library.}

%flexible in that one can encode any type of parameter with a distribution that is normal up to a transformation, i.e.
%normal (identity transformation), log-normal (natural logarithm) or logit-normal (logit tranformation).}

\feat{Higher levels of variability above BSV.} Such as variability between countries or centres.
\feat{Lower levels of variability below IOV.} Such as variability between sub-occasions within occasions.
\end{features}

\subsubsection{Observations Model}

\pharmml currently only supports the following observation model:
\begin{features}
\feat{Continuous observation model.} A residual error model applied to one or more variables in the structural model.
\feat{Autocorrelation of the residual errors in a continuous observation model.}
\end{features}

\subsection{Trial Design}

\pharmml can encode the following features of a trial design \emph{explicitly}\footnote{As
opposed to the implicit trial design definition present within a data file.}:

% \end{itemize}


% \section{MS Intro}

% Any part of human and animal anatomy and physiology can be subject to pathological changes and eventually diseases. The scope of pharmacometric models, dealing with virtually any type of such cases, is therefore almost without precedence in science. The models can be
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% phenomenological or mechanistic
% \item
% they have to cope both with continuous and discrete data types
% \item
% they are deterministic, stochastic or mixture of both
% \item
% they cover all levels of complexity from the molecular to organ and whole body level
% \end{itemize}
% It is a challenging endeavour to accommodate this variety of possibilities under one computational standard but thanks excellent use cases and other documents created and provided by our DDMoRe partners it seams possible. However it is indispensable to split the task into multiple steps of subsequent specifications and to define precisely the scope of every release. This is exactly the goal of this chapter.


% \section{Components of a pharmacometric model}
% In the context of PharmML a typical pharmacometric model can be decomposed into the following components
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% Data model
% \item
% Trial design model
% \item
% Structural model
% \item
% Parameter model
% \begin{itemize}
% \item

% Variability model
% \item
% Correlation of random effects
% \end{itemize}
% \item
% Residual error model
% \item
% Observation model
% \item
% Task model
% \end{itemize}
% In the following sections we describe each of these components briefly and list features which are implemented in the current specification and those which will be included in future releases (the latter listed in the subsections \textit{\textbf{Out of scope}}).

% \section{Features in and outside of current scope}

% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Structural model}
% In the current specification only continuous models are considered and any model which can be formulated using
% as system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) or algebraic equations can be implemented. More precisely, the following options are available
% \paragraph{PK models}

% \begin{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% Discrete data models
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% nominal and ordered categorical models e.g. logistic regression, proportional odds models etc.

% \item
% (Hidden) Markov models
% \item
% stochastic differential equations (SDE)
% \item
% delay differential equations (SDE)
% \item
% partial differential equations (PDE)
% \end{itemize}


% \subsection{Parameter model}
% As described in detail in section \ref{sec:parameterModel}, the current specification allows for encoding of
% models which are linear in the transformed parameter which covers a majority of cases in practical applications.
% This approach is flexible in that one can encode any type of parameter which distribution is normal up to a transformation,
% i.e. normal (identity transformation), log-normal (natural logarithm) or logit-normal (logit tranformation).\\
% The parameter model consists of the following elements
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% population/typical value for the parameter
% \item
% continuous and categorical covariate model (covariates can be sampled from probability distributions)
% %---- estimating categorical distribution from external data file \\
% %---- sampling from known categorical distribution \\
% \item
% random effects of arbitrary level, see section \ref{sec:variabilityModel} for details
% \item
% correlation of random effects, described by a correlation or covariance matrix
% \end{itemize}

% \subparagraph{Out of scope}
% The following features are planned for a subsequent release:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% non-linear parameter models, such as those described in \cite{Keizer:2011aa}
% \item
% autocorrelation of residual errors
% \item
% clusters of categorical covariates
% \item
% conditional distributions of continuous covariates
% \item
% selection/exclusion criteria for covariates
% \end{itemize}


% \subsection{Residual error model}
% PharmML is flexible with respect to defining residual error models. Currently this can be done
% only explicitly as there is no external library, see section \ref{sec:residualErrorModel}.
% For a future release the creation of an external library is planned.

% \subsection{Observation model}
% The following information can be stored in PharmML
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% model variable to be observed, both for continuous PK or PD models
% \item
% time points for every model varaiable at which predictions are to be estimated
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Task model}
% This model describes a combination of the operations one can perform on the model, such as:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% simulation of a trial design, defined explicitly in PharmML or encoded in a data file
% \item
% estimation of population or individual parameters
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% using the trial design designed in PharmML and objective data encoded in a data file
% \item
% using the trial design and objective data encoded in a data file
% \end{itemize}
% \item
% model exploration, e.g. sensitivity analysis
% \end{itemize}

% \subparagraph{Out of scope}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item
% export of simulation results to an external file
% \item
% export of estimation results to an external file
% \item
% transfer of results from one modelling step to another, for example transferring estimation results to a simulation step
% \end{itemize}


% \paragraph{Inference methods supported in PharmML}
% In general the current specification is restricted to estimation methods utilising the maximum likelihood principle. Not in the scope are Bayesian inference methods such as Maximum a posteriori (MAP) or Bayesian inference sing Gibbs sampling methods used in tools of the BUGS-family (winBUGS \cite{Lunn:2002aa}, openBUGS \cite{Lunn:2009fk}) or JAGS \cite{JAGS:2003aa}.



% %\paragraph{Covariate model}
% %Covariate model is barely covered so far. See also \cite{Keizer:2011aa}. Missing are following features:\\
% %For categorical covariates:\\
% %-- categorical distribution of categorical covariates \\
% %---- estimating categorical distribution from external data file \\
