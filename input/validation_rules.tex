\section{Introduction}

In this section we provide detailed rules about what constitutes a
valid \pharmml document. Where possible we have tried to keep each
rule definition discrete and also we have provided a unique
identifier for such rules. We recommend that developers implementing
support for \pharmml validation report such rule identifiers in their
error messages. Users can then cross-reference such errors with this
specification if they require more detailed information.

The rules are organised so that we cover the basic language features
and constructs first and then go into specific rules for each of the
sections of a \pharmml document: Model Definition, Trial Design and
Modelling Steps.

\section{Rule Identification}

The rule numbers use in this chapter are \emph{not} consistent with
those in the previous specification. Because so many rules changed
since the last version of \pharmml, particularly in the trial design
section, that we decided to start afresh. However, our intention is
that the rule numbers used here will be persistent\footnote{Keeping
  rule numbers persistent will help users and developers as they move
  between different versions of \pharmml. If validation reports an
  error with the same number in different versions of \pharmml then
  you can be sure that it is the same rule.}. Certainly within major
releases of \pharmml. In practice this means is a rule becomes
obsolete then it will not be reused and if it changes significantly in
substance then again it will be discarded and a new rule created in
it's place. This means that rule numbers are not sequential and will
have gaps in number over time.

\section{Namespaces and Scopes}
\label{sec:symbolScoping}

\subsection{Defining Symbols and Objects}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{scope_namespaces_overview}
\caption{An overview of the scopes and namespaces used in
  \pharmml. The class of symbols within the scope are shown as
  lozenges, symbols that also define a scope are rounded rectangles
  and the global scope is shown as rectangles. So for example, the
  function argument is a class of symbol that is scoped by the
  function definition which in turn belongs to the global scope.}
\label{fig:scopes-overview}
\end{figure}

The namespaces and scopes used in \pharmml are shown in
figure~\ref{fig:scopes-overview}. By namespace we mean essentially a
dictionary of names, in which each name must be unique within its
given scope. As you can see. As you can see from the figure there are
two namespaces, one which defines the symbols used to describe the
model (for more background information read section~\ref{sec:blocks})
and the other (namespace Element) is used to allow the \pharmml
document to be cross references externally (see
section~\ref{sec:element-id}).  The symbols can be classified as
follows:
\begin{description}
\item[Independent Variable] A special variable that defines the
  independent variable used throughout the model.
\item[Function Definition] A function that can be reused throughout
  the \pharmml document.
\item[Function Argument] The parameters of the function. Their scope
  extends into the body of the function as you would expect. For
  example: $f(x) = x + 1$.
\item[Object] An identifier used to uniquely identify conceptual
  objects within the \pharmml document.
\item[Block] An identifier that defines a model within the Model
  Definition section of \pharmml. This provides a scope for symbols
  defined within the block and gives the model definition a degree of
  modularity.
\item[Variability Level] A symbol that defines a level of random
  variability.
\item[Covariate] A symbol that defines variability associated with an
  individual. It can be continuous or categorical. In the latter case
  categories are scoped by the covariate symbol.
\item[Category] A category of a categorical covariate.
\item[Simple Parameter] A parameter that cannot be assigned a random variable.
\item[Individual Parameter] A parameter that can be assigned a random
  variable.
\item[Random Variable] A special parameter than is described by a
  probability distribution.
\item[Variable] A variable in the model. This is distinguished from a
  parameter in that it can change over time, while a parameter cannot.
\item[Element ID] An identifier used by external resources to identify
  a specific element within the \pharmml document.
\end{description}
%
Using these concepts we can apply the following rule:
%
\begin{valrules}
  \valrule{S1}{Symbols must belong to one of the classes described
    above.}
\valrule{S2}{The scope and namespace of a symbol is determined by its class.} The
scope and namespace of each class is described in figure~\ref{fig:scopes-overview}.
  \valrule{S3}{Symbols must be unique with their scopes.} Duplicate
  symbols are not permitted within a given namespace.
\end{valrules}

\subsection{Symbol Resolution}
\label{sec:ref-symbol-resolution}

Symbols must be resolved using the scoping rules. This is described in
detail in section~\ref{sec:blocks}. Symbols are typically referred to
using the \xelem{SymbRef} element and objects by the \xelem{OidRef} element
or XML elements of type OidRefType. Resolution rules are:

\begin{valrules}
\valrule{S4}{References to symbols and objects must resolved.}
Dangling references are not permitted.
\valrule{S5}{The resolved symbol must be compatible \pharmml
  component referencing it.} By this we mean that an \xelem{ArmRef}
which should match an arm definition should not point to an Epoch
definition. Compatibility is defined in the table below.
\valrule{S6}{A \xelem{SymbRef} element must only reference symbols
  that are compatible with its parent element.} Compatibility is
defined by table~\ref{tab:symbref-targets}.  
\valrule{S7}{A \xelem{OidRef} element or element using the type
  \texttt{OidRefType} must only reference objects
  that are compatible with its parent element.} Compatibility is
defined by table~\ref{tab:oidref-targets}.  
\end{valrules}

\topcaption{This table describes the compatibility of symbol
  references defined using \xelem{SymbRef}. The comparability is with
  the parent elements that use the \xelem{SymbRef} to refer to other
  symbols within the \pharmml document. In the table the Reference
  Parent column describes the element which is the immediate parent of
  the \xelem{SymbRef} element. The target column specifies the set
  of elements that can be the target of this reference. Where the
  parent element is required to identify the correct element a 'path'
  is indicated using the '/' symbol. Where more than one element is
  possible each option is separated by the '|' symbol.}

\section{Type System}

\subsection{Types}

\pharmml has the types in the following table. Some types can be
automatically converted (promoted) to another type. The rules are
described below, with detailed information provides in the following
tables.

\begin{valrules}
\valrule{S8}{\pharmml has a type system and all symbols and elements,
  if they have a type must conform it.} The types are specified in table~\ref{tab:type-specification}.
\valrule{S9}{Symbol classes have a type.} The types are specified in table~\ref{tab:symbol-class-types}.
\valrule{S10}{Some XML elements have a type.} The types are specified in table~\ref{tab:element-types}.
\valrule{S11}{Elements must be associated with quantities of same type} Quantities
associated elements in a \pharmml document, must be of the same
type. The type of the relevant elements are described in
table~\ref{tab:element-types}.
\valrule{S12}{Literal values have a type.} The types of literal values
are specified in table~\ref{tab:literal-types}.
\end{valrules}

\topcaption{Symbols can be created using these types. The types that can be used
with each symbol class can vary. In other cases the type is
implicit. This information is defined in the table below. Note that if
the type is ``explicit'' then this means that the range of possible
types are specified in the XML document and that the possible types are
encoded in the XML Schema definition.}

\section{Common Constructs}

\subsection{Assignment}

An assignment operation evaluates an expression, that may be a literal
value, a reference to a symbols or a mathematical equation. It then
associates that expression with a symbol, such as variable, parameter
or covariate, or with an element in the XML document. An assignment is
indicated by the \xelem{Assign} element. The following rules apply:

\begin{valrules}
  \valrule{S13} {No circular assignment for non-derivative symbols} A
  circular assignment occurs if a symbol is initialised with an
  expression that when traced through the definition of each symbol in
  the expression ends back where it started. This generally
  prohibited, but permitted if the symbol being initialised is of
  derivative type. See section \ref{sec:blocks} for a more detailed
  description.
%
  \valrule{S14}{A symbol can be assigned to only once.} See section
  \ref{sec:blocks}.
%
\valrule{S15}{Both sides of an assignment must have the same type.}
This means that the expression (the right-hand side of the assignment)
must evaluate to have a type that is identical to that of the symbol
or element it is to be associated with (the left-hand side).
\end{valrules}

\subsection{Mapping to a Dataset}

Elements map the symbol or model to a column in the \xelem{DataSet}
using the \xelem{ColumnRef} element. This gives us the following rules:

\begin{valrules}
  \valrule{S16}{A column reference must always to resolve to a
    column in its associated dataset.} The associated dataset is clear
  from the content of reference in the XML Schema structure. To
  resolve correctly the value \xatt{columnIdRef} attribute must be identical
  to that of the \xatt{columnId} attribute in Column definition of
  dataset.
\valrule{S17}{A mapping between a symbol or object to a column in a
  dataset must be type consistent.} By this we mean that the type of
the object or element (defined in the table~\ref{tab:data-set-mapping}) must be the same as
the type specified in the column definition of the dataset.
\end{valrules}

\topcaption{There are a number of mapping constructs in \pharmml that assign the
values in the column of a dataset to symbols in the model or objects,
for example to instantiate the trial design. In some cases the symbol
or object mapped to is implied by the mapping element, in other cases
this is explicitly defined with a \xelem{SymbRef} or \xelem{OidRef}
element.}

\end{mpxtabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Array Literal Types}

Symbols of array type cannot be define in \pharmml, but there are
cases where it is useful to define an array of values, for example
when defining a set of dosing times. \pharmml provides two ways to do
this. The \xelem{Sequence} element specifies a uniform sequence of
numerical values and the \xelem{Vector} defines an ordered
list of scalar values. Their usage is governed by the following rules.

\begin{valrules}
\valrule{C1}{Sequence element validation rules.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Step size cannot be 0.
\item Steps greater than 0 implies that Begin must be greater than or equal to End.
\item Steps les than 0 implies that Begin must be less than or equal
  to End.
\item Repetitions must be greater than or equal to zero.
\item The type of the sequence must be consistent. Types may be
  promoted to maintain type consistency. For example if the value of
  the step size is real type and the begin and end elements have
  integer values then all will be promoted to a real type and the
  construct will generate sequence of real numbers.
\end{enumerate}

\valrule{C2}{Vector validation rules.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item It must contain values that are type
consistent. Types may be promoted to main type consistency, in which
case all values in the vector will be of the promoted type.
\item The order of elements in the vector are significant. Values can
  be repeated and the values are not sorted in any way.
\end{enumerate}
\end{valrules}

\section{Dataset}

The dataset defines a table of data. It is described in some detail in
section~\ref{sec:dataset}.

\begin{valrules}
\valrule{DS1}{Columns are ordered. The order is specified by the
  \xatt{columnNum} attribute.}
\valrule{DS2}{Columns must be numbered sequentially from 1, with no
  gaps in the sequence.}
\valrule{DS3}{Each dataset must have one or more columns assigned a
  s a unique key.} If more than 1 column then the combination of
column values together defines the key.
\valrule{DS4}{Rows with a identical key values are forbidden.} The
rows in the dataset must be unique with respect its unique key.
\valrule{DS5}{Key columns cannot define a nested table.}
\valrule{DS6}{Each cell must contain a value that is type compatible
with the column definition.}
\valrule{DS7}{All cells in a column must have the same type.}
\valrule{DS8}{Each row must define a cell for each column.}
\valrule{DS9}{A cell that is in a column defining a nested table,
  must instantiate a nested table.} If a column defines a nested table
then that data in the table must be described using an \xelem{Table}
element. The nested table is a properly constituted dataset and these
consistency rules apply to it.
\valrule{DS10}{A dataset has a unique key.} The keys of each dataset
used in \pharmml are defined in table~\ref{tab:dataset-keys}.
\end{valrules}

\topcaption{Unique keys for datasets used in \pharmml.}

\section{Maths}
\label{sec:phmaths-defns}

As described in more detail in section~\ref{sec:maths} the definition
of mathematical expressions in \pharmml relies on a combination of
literal values, symbol references, and binary and unary
operators. The operands of the operators needs more detailed
definition.

\subsection{Numerical Operators}

\begin{valrules}
\valrule{T1}{The operands of the binary numerical operators have
  specified semantics.} The semantics are defined in
table~\ref{tab:bin-op-semantics}.
\valrule{T2}{The operands of the unary numerical operators have
  specified semantics.} The semantics are defined in
table~\ref{tab:unary-op-semantics}.
\valrule{T3}{All numerical operators take one or more operands of type real and
return a result of type real.}

\section{Global rules}

These rules apply to the whole \pharmml document.

\begin{valrules}
\valrule{G1}{The model is assumed to be initialised at $t=0$} $t$ is
the symbol for the independent variable --- defined in the
\xelem{IndependentVariable} element. Because the model is not
initialised it follows that estimation and simulation steps with
values of $t<0$ are invalid.
\valrule{G2}{The default independent variable symbols id \texttt{t}}
This is the value used when no \xelem{IndependentVariable} element is defined
  in a \pharmml document.
\end{valrules}

\section{ModelDefinition}

The following rules relate to the \xelem{ModelDefinition} element and
its children.

\begin{valrules}
\valrule{M1}{Only one uninitialised category permitted in a
  categorical covariates}
If one category is assigned a value in the ModelDefinition then all
but ast most one category must be assigned a
value.
\valrule{M2}{Categories of a categorical covariate must equal 1}
If all categories are assigned a value then they must sum to 1. If one cat is unassigned then it has a probability of 1-sum of all
other categories.
\valrule{M4} {Correctly defined covariance matrix} If both random
effects being correlated are Normal then we can calculate the diagonal
of the covariance. We only need to calculate the off-diagonal
elements. Otherwise the full upper triangular matrix must be defined.
\valrule{M5} {All Variability Levels must be used} All variability
levels in the model definition must be used by at least one random
effect in the model.
\valrule{M6} {Random effect correlations must be unique} A
correlation between identical random effects at the same variability
level of the model is forbidden.
\valrule{M7}{The variability levels within a particular type must be
  defined as a list.} Each variability level can only have a maximum of one child
level and one parent level. Variability levels that belong to models
with different types (specified by the \xatt{type} attribute) cannot
be linked.
\end{valrules}


\section{Trial Design}

\begin{valrules}
\valrule{D1}{Demographic values of same type.} The values of a demographic,
specified by the \xelem{Demogra\-phic} element, must all have the same
type.
\valrule{D2}{Dosing cannot start before the model is initialised.} This
means that all dosing times must start at or after the initial time of
the model.
\valrule{D3}{IV dependent attributes cannot begin before the model is
  initialised.} For example a time dependent covariate cannot occur
before the initial time of the model.
\valrule{D4}{Single dose amount and multiple dosing times permitted.} In a
dosing regiment, if a single dose amount is specified with multiple
doses then this indicates that the same dose amount should be
administered at each dosing time.
\valrule{D5}{Multiple dose amount and multiple dosing times permitted.} In a
dosing regiment, if a multiple doses amount is specified with multiple
doses then each dose amount is administered at the corresponding
dosing time. The order of the amounts and times is significant so the
first amount is administered at the first time and so on. Note that
the vectors of amount and time must be \emph{exactly the same length}.
\valrule{D6}{More than one dosing time implies multiple dosing.}
\valrule{D7}{Dosing times cannot be less than zero.} See rule G1.
\valrule{D6}{Epoch periods cannot be less than zero.} See rule G1.
\valrule{D8}{An Epoch period must progress in time.} The end of an epoch
must be equal to or after its beginning. It must also have both a start and end time.
\valrule{D9}{A trial structure must be complete.} A \xelem{Structure}
element must contain at least one each of Epoch, Arm, Cell, Segment
and Activity.
\valrule{D10}{An Observation Group period must progress in time.} The end
of an observation group must be after its beginning. It must also have
a duration greater than zero. It must also have both a start and end
time.
\valrule{D11}{Dosing times relative to epoch.} Dosing times are
relative to the start time of the epoch to which they are assigned.
\valrule{D12}{If dosing type is \texttt{target} then the dosing variable must be a
derivative variable.}
\valrule{D13}{If dosing type is \texttt{dose} then the dosing variable must be a
non-derivative variable.}
\valrule{D14}{Multiple dosing of type \texttt{target}.} If dosing is of type
\texttt{target} then the dose is added to the dosing variable at the
dosing time.
%
\valrule{D15}{Multiple dosing of type \texttt{dose}.} If dosing is
of type \texttt{dose} then the structural model to which the dose is
applied must be algebraic. This structural model, $C$, must then be
summed over each dose and time-point to give the output variable,
$C_{\mathit{sum}}$, as follows:
%
\[
C_{\mathit{sum}}(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} C(D_i, t_{D_i}, t)
\]
\end{valrules}


% \subsection{Multiple Dosing}
% \label{rules:mult-dosing}

% Multiple dosing takes two forms.


\section{Modelling Step}

\begin{valrules}
\valrule{L1} {A trial design section must be defined if a simulation
  step is defined.}
\valrule{L2} {A trial design section must be defined for an estimation
step is defined.}
\valrule{L3}{No uninitialised symbols} All symbols such as variables,
parameters, and covariates must be initialised. By initialised we mean
that they must have an initial assignment (including an initial
condition) or an initial estimate defined.
\valrule{L4}{Times used in a modelling step cannot occur before the
  initial time of the model.} In practise this means that negative
times are prohibited.
\end{valrules}
